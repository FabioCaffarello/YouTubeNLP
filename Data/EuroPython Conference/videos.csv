By Dustin Ingram

Python is well-known as a programming language without static types. This means that you don’t need to say what a given variable will hold, or whether your function will return a string or an integer (or sometimes one, and sometimes another!). This has historically made Python a very flexible and beginner-friendly language.

In this talk, we’ll discuss the advantages and disadvantages to a static type system, as well as recent efforts to introduce static typing to Python via optional “type hints” and various tools to aid in adding types to Python code. We’ll see what this means for Python, for Python programmers, and what the future has in store for Python’s type system.

By Nisarg Shah

GraphQL technology has become popular nowadays. While developing REST APIs, there are many things that developers need to take into consideration. There are multiple endpoints and over-fetching is the main problem of REST. GraphQL offers a unique approach and architecture for developing APIs. How is that efficient?

While using GraphQL, a client can request the data which is needed. It is an alternative for building APIs in place of REST. It’s a query language that can work as a medium between the frontend and backend. 

The journey to develop GraphQL APIs in python needs some requirements and knowledge. We will be building APIs in the Django framework using a graphene library which includes many features of GraphQL such as ObjectTypes, Queries, Mutations, etc. We will start by understanding these concepts followed by some code. This includes detailed information about the Query class, what are resolvers, and where to write business logic, how pagination can be incorporated with queries would be included. Also, it will include the information about the Mutation class, arguments needed for mutation, and what type of response can be returned on successful operations. 

Learning outcomes would be the understanding of code and building GraphQL APIs using graphene in a proper and structured way.

There's a profound gap between working code and Pythonic code. To the developer whose first language is NOT Python, the distinction can appear blurry, even arbitrary. What is this """"one obvious way"""" all those Python nerds are going on about?

Most of us are familiar with the """"Zen of Python"""", Tim Peters's legendary, if tongue-in-cheek, set of guiding principles for the Python language. But can they actually inform Pythonic code?

In this talk, Jason C. McDonald will unpack how the twenty principles (including the unwritten rule) of the Zen can guide you to write beautiful, maintainable code, by treating Python AS Python!

This talk is intended primarily for developers who have come to Python from another language, no matter their experience level. McDonald will shed light on how to work WITH Python's type system, statements, and iterative tools, rather than against them. You'll walk away with a new appreciation of the language, and an understanding of what Pythonic really means; an understanding which will empower you to find the One Obvious Way to solve any problem in Python.

Writing API guidelines is a best practice for standardizing APIs produced by thousands of service provider, but what happens when those rules are not backed by internet standards?

This talk proposes an iterative strategy for identify and standardize inside IETF key features of your API guidelines.
The steps includes feature landscaping, stakeholder identification and engagement, prototyping and writing an actual internet-draft.

The strategy is shown using two examples:
- rewriting of codeDigest/code header RFC3230 adding clarifications useful for implementors;
- proposing new codeRateLimit/code headers and engage with implementors (Microsoft, Red Hat, Kong, ..).

Rust is a rising star of the programming language world. I'd like to discuss it from a Python developer perspective. Obviously, Rust is not a replacement for Python, but in case you're seeking better performance it may be a good idea to build an extension. This is safer and arguably easier to do in Rust than in C.
In this talk we will take a look at existing crates that provide interface to Python and see how easy it is to use them.
Then we go through the demo and see it in action.
Run some benchmarks against pure Python and also Cython.
Write a Dockerfile to build it all together.
Discuss CI/CD for mixed Rust/Python projects.

There is a wealth of amazing tools freely available to open source software developers to use to maintain their projects. Practically every problem we face or are likely to face in software development has been lived through and solved many times over. Patterns emerge for dealing with development practises and we build our software using the tools made by the previous generation of developers.

We're very fortunate to operate in an amazing open source ecosystem where we've learned we're stronger when we build on each other's foundations. We're constantly laying new foundations for ourselves and we share our ways of working with the world. We now have a very sophisticated set of tools for developing, managing, testing and documenting our new projects without reinventing the wheel.

But we don't discover all the tools at once - we pick them up as we go along, as we find uses for them and we hear about them. I'm going to share a range of great tools I use to maintain some popular open source Python projects, and explain how the difference they've made.

The talk covers:


Software packaging and distribution
Licensing
Virtual environments
Software testing
Continuous integration
Git &amp; GitHub
Contributor community
Project management tools
Documentation tools


The talk demonstrates examples for development of Python projects on Linux, but the tools can be used cross-language and cross-platform.

People have names. Most people do. People have first names and last names. Many people do. People have any sorts of names that often don't fit fixed fields in the forms. These names may contain letters, accented letters, and other characters, that may cause problems to your code depending on the encoding you use. They may look differently in uppercase and lowercase, or may not be case foldable at all. Searching and sorting these names may be tricky too. And if you design an application, web form, and/or database dealing with personal names, you'll have to take that into account.

This talk is not about GDPR, but will help you to use the best tools to handle encoding and locales in Python and prevent your application from appearing in my talk and in uxfails memes.

virtualenv is a tool that builds virtual environments for Python. It was first created in September 2007 and lived most of its life being a single file project with an increasing amount of (scary) workarounds within. It managed to grow until it was 2,700 lines of code. Maintaining this project became increasingly more troublesome, to the point where, we had more than 500 open issues at one point. In July 2019, I started working from scratch on a rewrite, with the goal of not just increasing the project's maintainability, but also to make it faster and add some new features that were just impossible or too hard to do in the existing code base. Fast forward six months to January 2020, when we released the first beta, with the first full release coming out on 10th February. It took a bit more than a month to squash all the open bugs tickets, but April started without any remaining open bug tickets. This talk will cover the lessons I've learned while on this journey.

A full-text search on a website is the best way to make its contents easily accessible to users because it returns better results and is in fact used in online search engines or social networks.

The implementation of full-text search can be complex and many adopt the strategy of using dedicated search engines in addition to the database, but in most cases this strategy turns out to be a big problem of architecture and performance.

In this talk we'll see a pythonic way to implement full-text search on a website using only Django and PostgreSQL, taking advantage of all the innovations introduced in latest years, and we'll analyse the problems of using additional search engines with examples deriving from my experience (e.g. djangoproject.com or readthedocs.org).

Through this talk you can learn how to add a full-text search on your website, if it's based on Django and PostgreSQL, or you can learn how to update the search function of your website if you use other search engines.

Django is a popular, solid web framework for perfectionists with deadlines, with a wide ecosystem of packages that extend its powers in multiple directions. In the era of peaking popularity of Node/Deno, microservices, and heavyweight browser rendered webapps, Django still remains a triumphant monolith maker, very capable of major undertakings in the web arena.

For all you Django-lovers out there, it seems to me like a matter of time before you have to do some form of multi-tenancy in Django. Taking a solution that works well for one tenant and extending it to multiple tenants should still be a problem for perfectionists with deadlines. Interestingly, when it comes to covering all the many facets of multi-tenancy, Django can be not so batteries included, as one might end up working around or 'hacking' the framework in order to get things done.

In this talk I will walk you through the challenges of bringing multi-tenancy to a Django project. We'll cover the fundamental plumbing required to make it work reliably, securely, and elegantly. You will be expected to have a basic knowledge of Django (models, settings, users, URL reversing), and you will learn the working logic behind popular multi-tenancy packages like a href=""""https://github.com/bernardopires/django-tenant-schemas""""django-tenant-schemas/a and a href=""""https://github.com/tomturner/django-tenants""""django-tenants/a.

EuroPython 2020 - Talk - 2020-07-23 - Brian
Online

By Kanianthra Chandy

Sensors, social media, news feeds, webcams and other sources generate streams of data which are analyzed to control actuators, generate alerts, and feed displays. These applications process streams on onboard computers, such as the Raspberry Pi, connected directly to sensors, and send summarized information to the cloud for further processing. These applications have two characteristics: (1) Concurrency: The applications are concurrent using multiple threads to connect to sensors and actuators, shared memory across multiple processes on multicore machines and message passing for distributed systems spanning multiple computers. (2) Data Analysis: The applications use programs from a variety of libraries including those for signal processing, machine learning and natural language processing.

Developers of streaming applications can use open-source software to deal with both characteristics. Concurrency: multiprocessing.Array can be used to construct shared-memory multiprocessing Python programs in multicore computers, and frameworks such as APMQ and Kafka can be used to build distributed applications. Data Analysis: A vast collection of open-source Python libraries can be used to analyze data in streams. Developers of streaming applications encounter an impedance mismatch between the software libraries that address these two characteristics. The next paragraph describes the mismatch and how IoTPy addresses it. 

Programs in most software libraries apply a function to data, get results, and terminate execution. By contrast, streaming applications are perpetual processes that analyze endless streams of data. IoTPy helps developers: (1) build non-terminating streaming applications by harnessing conventional terminating programs from Python’s huge base of libraries and (2) create multithreaded, multicore and distributed Python applications by simply connecting streams to each other.

By Itamar Turner-Trauring

You know the basics of packaging your Python application for Docker, but do you know enough to run that image in production? Bad packaging can result in security and production problems, not to mention wasted time try to debug unreproducible errors.

And even if you figure out the best practices, there's still a huge number of details to get right, many of which interact with each other in unexpected ways. My personal list includes over 60 Docker packaging best practices, and it keeps growing. So where do you start? What should you do first?

To help you quickly package your application in a production-ready way, this talk will give you a plan to help you prioritize and iteratively implement these best practices, by starting with the highest priority best practices (security, automation), moving on the correctness and reproducibility, and finally focusing on optimization.

To make this process more concrete, along the way you'll also learn some of the techniques needed to build production-ready images:


Running as a non-root, for increased security.
Debugging C crashes with faulthandler.
Faster startup with pre-compiled .pycs.
Smaller images by disabling pip caching.
Avoiding Alpine Linux.
And more!


At the end of the talk you'll also get some resources to teach you even more best practices that can't be fit in a 30-minute talk.

This talk is for Python programmers who know the basics of Docker packaging, and need to run the resulting images in a production environment.

The introduction of PEP-484 gave us an option to enforce the internal type consistency of our Python applications. Our web projects, however, consist of multiple layers, with the Python app taking the role of an HTTP backend. What options do we have to ensure consistency across our stack?
In this talk, we will see some technologies that we can employ to enforce the contract between the layers of our stack. Especially between the frontend and backend. We will demo, how this can be achieved with REST/Swagger and with GraphQL. As both the Graphene library and the open API support for django-rest-framework are both a work-in-progress, we would check, what is possible, and what is still lacking. We will also discuss various approaches to the design: backend first, auto-generating backend from the spec, and TDD, with their advantages and disadvantages.
The topic would be discussed on a simple web application. We would try to play some realistic scenarios, where a careless developer breaks the contract to see how such a mistake can be spotted in the CI phase of the development cycle.
Basic knowledge of Django and JavaScript is required to understand the talk. Some familiarity with TypeScript and ReactJS would also be helpful. However, I plan to explain the code to the listeners that didn’t have prior exposure to these technologies.

By Nicholas Tollervey

One of the best aspects of any conference, and EuroPython in particular, is the corridor track. It's when you walk around the physical conference venue and bump into an old buddy, find yourself striking up a conversation with a friendly co-attendee in the coffee queue, or join a huddle of welcoming folks discussing something interesting. The corridor track is where the community comes alive.

How do we remotely recreate the opportunity for chance encounters, unexpected conversation and exploration of a venue and new city with friends?

We already have a template for a solution: MUDs (multi-user dungeons/dimensions), back in the day, were hugely popular virtual worlds of text. I asked myself, """"what would a MUD written in 2020 look like?"""". Then, rather foolishly, """"how hard can this be?"""". Happily, I'd written a MUD in Python as a recent entry to PyWeek.

This talk describes how I initially created, extended and then refined my very own MUD, written in Python using asyncio, structlog, sly, redis and other fun technology. What's more, this MUD is special because it's a programmable MUD: it's really a multi-user development platform for on-the-fly coding of interactive virtual worlds.

What could possibly go wrong..? Let's find out..!

Have you ever imagined life without your tests breaking due to an external dependency having changed? My team chased the dream. We used mocks, stubs, other dependency isolation techniques, and the result was … a lot of ugly tests.

We soon realized our tests required more care and they invoked some difficult questions. Is it possible that the limitations of the testing framework add or give away flaws on your design? Should your architecture be affected by your efforts to test the system? What did we learn in the process?

This presentation will introduce some testing isolation concepts and discuss how the choice of each can affect your architecture design. We will go through the basics of the unittest.mock library and the pytest framework and explore their potential. By diving into scenarios, attendees will learn where these features can be applied more effectively, and more importantly, how an API design can and should be driven by the value of testability, allowing the tests to be structured around clarity, readability and a happy Continuous Integration platform.

The target audience includes beginner Pythonistas, who are looking for ways to structure and test their code cleanly, while intermediate developers will enjoy a fun refreshment on dependency isolation and leave the session with practical examples on how to use it more effectively.

Looking at higher redshifts is equivalent to looking back in time: they improve the studies of cosmology, expanding our knowledge of the universe. It allows us to study various physical phenomena like the power spectrum of galaxies which describes the distribution of galaxies on a range of scales, galaxy clustering, and large scales, the detection of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation feature. 
As a result,  a significant amount of work has been done to increase the efficiency and accuracy of the process via new algorithms and optimization of existing ones.
Astronomical datasets are undergoing a rapid growth in size and complexity as past, ongoing and future surveys produce massive multi-temporal and multi-wavelength datasets, with huge information to be extracted and analyzed.
The alternative to a full spectroscopic survey is to obtain multi-color images of the sky and perform photometric redshift estimates for the galaxies we have available. 
When dealing with this problem, there are two main approaches: model-driven data analysis (template fitting methods) and data-driven analysis, which can use machine learning methods.
To solve this problem, we use data-driven analysis, more specifically GPz (which uses Gaussian processes)  and  ANNz2 (which mainly uses neural networks), both python software.

Generative Models are the Swiss Army Knife for the Decision Scientist. Generative models allow the simulation of scenarios based on different business hypotheses (Bayesian priors). With Probabilistic Programming, decision makers can simulate the impact of business drivers in times of great uncertainty.

Furthermore, Probabilistic Programming Languages provide all the inference tools necessary to identify the assumptions that have most likely generated an outcome. Inference is a statistical tool that enables optimal decision-making based on models that explicitly quantify uncertainty.

Generative models of key optimization parameters are necessary input to Robust Optimization and Stochastic Programming problems. 
Python provides all the tools to successfully integrate Probabilitistic Programs with Robust and Stochastic Optimization and therefore cope with high uncertainty in optimization.

With Python, when thinking of web frameworks, two that come into mind are Django and Flask. Instead of having to choose one of the two, this session shows how you can engineer Flask to achieve a simili-Django app. It's a dive into the internal components of Django and the idea behind. The session covers different Flask development patterns to finally finish with an app that's functionally similar to Django with some extra features in for free. It also lists some caveats identified with such a pattern. This session requires attendees to know Flask and having used Django for building at least one project. At the very least it assumes the knowledge of models, views, controller, templates and migrations. It discusses along the way the educational and pedagogical aspect of learning web frameworks and proposes a syllabus. It discusses the benefits of learning Flask and the necessity of learning the two as a Pythonista. Django is the go-to framework for web development and it's no surprise that most freelancing jobs require Django. Flask is appreciated for the flexibility it gives. The session also touches about how we can better promote Flask through education. The session finishes with the hurdles identified when getting started with web development in Python, pulled from personal teaching experience.

By Ruud van der Ham

In the Python landscape, there are several high-end GUI packages. Of course, there’s tkinter which is part of the standard library. And there is wxPython and several versions of Qt. What they share is that they are very flexible but not only have a steep learning curve but also take considerable development effort to realize even a simple user interface.
At the other of the spectrum, there are several design tools that either generate code of a layout structure. In many cases, the functionality is rather limited, though.
Relatively recent, an independent open-source developer (not me) has made a product that tries to bridge the gap between these two worlds: PySimpleGUI. This package runs on top of tkinter, QT for Windows, wxPython and Remi.
In this talk, I want to show the design methodology behind this fascinating product that might change the way people look at GUIs.
I will start with live coding a simple yet not evident program that shows the basic concepts. With this, I will demonstrate the design philosophy.
PySimpleGUI can also be used to implement a user-friendly interface as opposed to command-line interfaces.
From there, I will give an overview of some more elements present in this package.
Finally, I will show a full-featured GUI program with several bells and whistles.

Developing machine learning models is easy; training, deploying, monitoring, scaling, and maintaining them in an automated fashion - all while maintaining your sanity - is hard. 

In this session, I'll discuss the infrastructure and tooling my small team of data science practitioners and engineers is using to manage and orchestrate the machine learning model lifecycle, including pitfalls we've encountered along the way. Particular attention will be paid to where we've opted to use off-the-shelf solutions versus developing our own, the importance of developer ergonomics, and how to maximally empower data scientists to get their work into production without the need for a dedicated MLOps team.

The talk will cover our ML stack as it exists in production today, and will touch on our application of a number of technologies and techniques, including:
- AWS SageMaker
- Airflow
- Docker
- Cookiecutter
- Property-based testing
- Jsonschema
- Linting
- Slack integration
- Model artifacts and diagnostics
- Automated deployments and rollbacks
- Healthchecks
- Autoscaling
- DBT

At the end of the session, attendees should expect to leave with new insights that they can apply immediately to their own ML systems and infrastructure, as well as a better understanding of how to minimize engineering and ops overhead, in the real world, across data science teams of any size and composition.

By Shreya Khurana

Natural language processing has seen leaps of technology progress with Machine Learning becoming the norm of solving the major problems in this area, with Machine translation being one of the major problems in this area. Neural machine translation systems are now used to convert sentences or phrases from one language to another, or in general, for sequence to sequence modeling. In this talk, we’ll be covering the steps from scratch to preprocess, train and serve a NMT model using PyTorch. While building a highly accurate model is a prerequisite to getting good quality translations, often in industry, we also need to make sure we can serve the model to customers without getting timeouts or delays. The practice of serving models requires creating a web app to get client requests and process them in a way the model would understand. For this, we’ll use  the various components of the application server environment - Flask, Docker, uwsgi and nginx. This talk is suitable for audience who is working in general with ML models and want to learn how to serve them or working specifically with NMT and want to learn about some quick prototyping tips. 

Prerequisites: Audience should be comfortable with the basic ML terminology and procedure of training models. NLP knowledge will be good, but is not a necessity as the focus will be on quick prototyping in production.

By the end of the talk, the audience will have:
- Learnt how to preprocess data for NLP systems
- Learnt how to quickly prototype and train a translation model
- Learnt how to create a web app for the NLP model using Flask
- Learnt how to containerize a pytorch model using Docker
- Learnt how to serve the model as an app using uwsgi, nginx and 

Outline:


Introduction to translation systems, machine translation framework

- Preprocessing data
- Training 
- Generating new translations 

Serving and prototyping 
- Flask app 
- Docker container br /
- Nginx + uwsgi + supervisord configurations

EuroPython 2020 - Talk - 2020-07-23 - Parrot Data Science

By William Horton

The Jupyter Notebook: many Python users love it, many other Python users love to hate it. But where did it come from? How did we come to have a tool that combines code execution, visualization, Markdown, and more? In this talk, we will dive into the development of the Jupyter Notebook and the older ideas that it built upon. 

To start, we will look at tools that popularized the “computational notebook” interface. In 1988, Mathematica introduced this interface to the scientific community. In the 90s, tools like Maple competed with Mathematica to provide the best scientific programming environment. The early 2000s saw the rise in popularity of open-source scientific tools in Python, including IPython, leading to IPython Notebook and then Jupyter.

Turning to the present, we look at the expanding ecosystem beyond the Notebook. JupyterLab provides a richer programming environment. Voilà and Binder give users better options for sharing their notebooks. And increased language support has led to Jupyter being a tool not only for Julia, Python, and R, but for dozens of other languages.

Finally: what is still to come? JupyerLab 2.0 promises even greater IDE-like capabilities, while IDEs increase their own Notebook support. Projects like Deepnote and CoCalc promise real-time collaboration on top of the Notebook interface. And the frustrations of working with Git are the source of a growing number of possible solutions. These efforts point us toward what the Jupyter Notebook could become.

Applications and libraries with a pluggable architecture allow developers to add custom functionality. Plugins can customize user interfaces, create new workflows, and interface with legacy systems. Designing a plugin is often difficult - documentation is sparse, outdated, or non-existent. You end up diving into a unfamiliar codebase to figure out what to do.

This talk examines Pluggable Architecture by creating a custom plugin system: we will design an interface, think about where to hook in custom behavior, and discuss testing techniques. Understanding these principles will enable us to write custom plugins for third-party libraries. Extend the functionality of your favourite library without touching existing code!

By Alejandro Saucedo

This talk will provide a practical insight on how to build scalable data streaming machine learning pipelines to process large datasets in real time using Python and popular frameworks such as Kafka, SpaCy and Seldon.

We will be covering a case study performing automated content moderation on Reddit comments in real time. Our dataset will consist of 200k reddit comments from /r/science, 50,000 of which have been removed by moderators. We will be handling the stream data in a Kubernetes cluster, and the stream processing will be handled using the stream processing library Kafka. We will be running the end-to-end pipeline in Kubernetes with various components legeraging SKLearn, SpaCy and Seldon.

We will then dive into fundamental concepts on stream processing such as windows, watermarking and checkponting, and we will show how to use each of these frameworks to build complex data streaming pipelines that can perform real time processing at scale by building, deploying and monitoring a machine learning model which will process production incoming data..

Finally we will show best practices when using these frameworks, as well as a high level overview of tools that can be used for monitoring in-depth.

By Eran Friedman

Our product uses a fleet of real (not virtual) robots to perform different tasks in a fulfillment warehouse. Simulation is an essential tool in this kind of product: it allows to perform regression tests and test new features without the need for real and expensive hardware, to compare the impact of different algorithms and optimizations, to inject failures, and more.

Tasks performed by physical robots take time (movement over the warehouse, box lifting, etc.), but in simulation, where virtual robots are used, there is no need to wait all that time. I will describe our implementation of the Discrete-Event Simulation approach which allows us to simulate hours of real-life in minutes.

Shortening simulation time improves the development process by providing faster feedback to developers and quicker CI and testing cycles. Another powerful advantage is a more deterministic simulation - using this approach, each component in the system gets equal opportunity (CPU time) in each time tick, which is not affected by the underlying machine that the simulation is running on. Also, it is possible to simulate any date and hour easily, and by that we wouldn't panic before the """"Y2K bug"""".

I will elaborate on some challenges we encountered: time leak of event-driven components, differences between dev and production environments and running a distributed simulation due to the transition to microservices.

There is many package mangers and  currently we have tools like pip, pipenv or poetry but it is not obvious which of them we should use in first place. Which of them are recommended to use? What are prons and cons of certain package mangers? Is there any other not well known packages mangers? How package mangers are packaging Python code? Which of the package mangers are good for data scientists? Is your package manger is resolving dependencies? 
    This questions can appear especially when you are beginner and just to want start working with Python. Unfortunately form the beginning you must face the problem which of the package manger you should use. In this presentation I will answer all of this questions. I will list popular package mangers and some not known. I will show differences and which of them are best for which case. Also I will explain differences between packages that are used by different packages mangers. If you are interested in code development and package mangers or you are just confused which of them you should use this presentation is definitely for you. During this presentation I will answer all questions and I will wipe out all doubts about packages, package mangers and virtualenvs.

By Chin Hwee Ong

In a data science project, one of the biggest bottlenecks (in terms of time) is the constant wait for the data processing code to finish executing. Slow code, as well as connectivity issues, affect every step of a typical data science workflow — be it for network I/O operations or computation-driven workloads. In this talk, I will be sharing about common bottlenecks in data processing within a typical data science workflow, and exploring the use of parallel and asynchronous programming using concurrent.futures module in Python to speed up your data processing pipelines so that you could focus more on getting value out of your data. Through real-life analogies, you will learn about:

ol
Sequential vs parallel processing,
Synchronous vs asynchronous execution,
Network I/O operations vs computation-driven workloads in a data science workflow,
When is parallelism and asynchronous programming a good idea,
How to implement parallel and asynchronous programming using concurrent.futures module to speed up your data processing pipelines
/ol

This talk assumes basic understanding of data pipelines and data science workflows. While the main target audience are data scientists and engineers building data pipelines, the talk is designed such that anyone with a basic understanding of the Python language would be able to understand the illustrated concepts and use cases.

By Naoise Holohan

Data privacy is having an ever-increasing impact on the way data is stored, processed, accessed and utilised, as the legal and ethical effects of data protection regulations take effect around the globe. Differential privacy, considered by many to be the strongest privacy guarantee currently available, gives robust, provable guarantees on protecting privacy, and allows tasks to be completed on data with guarantees on the privacy of individuals in that data. This naturally extends to machine learning, where training datasets can contain sensitive personal information, that are vulnerable to privacy attacks on trained models.
By using differential privacy in the training process, a machine learning model can be trained to accurately represent the dataset at large, but without inadvertently revealing sensitive information about an individual. Diffprivlib is the first library of its kind to leverage the power of differential privacy with scikit-learn and numpy to give data scientists and researchers access to the tools to train accurate, portable models with robust, provable privacy guarantees built-in.
In this talk, we will introduce attendees to the idea of differential privacy, why it is necessary in today's world, and how diffprivlib can be seamlessly integrated within existing scripts to protect your trained models from privacy vulnerabilities. Attendees will be expected to have a basic understanding of sklearn (i.e., how to initialise, fit and predict a model). No knowledge of data privacy or differential privacy will be assumed or required.

Architectural considerations are often overlooked by developers or completely delegated to a framework. We should start once again discussing how applications are structured, how components are connected and how to lower coupling between different parts of a system, to avoid creating software that cannot easily be maintained or changed.

The “clean architecture” model predates Robert Martin, who recently brought it back to the attention of the community, and is a way of structuring applications that leverages layers separation and internal APIs to achieve a very tidy, fully-tested, and loosely coupled system. The talk introduces the main ideas of the architecture, showing how the layers can be implemented in Python, following the content of the book “Clean Architectures in Python”. The book recently reached 11,000 downloads and many readers found it useful to start learning how to test software and how to structure an application without relying entirely on the framework.

It is wonderful to automate boring stuffs with Python.
In Japan, new introductory books are being published every month and more and more Pythonistas are working on automation.
A Python script that is useful to you may be useful to others.
So I talk about how to enable others to use your script.

In this talk, I use a simple script which can reduce the width and the height of a specified image in your computer.
I assume someone who's read the introductory book can understand the script.

First, I introduce Command Line Interface (CLI) to solve hardcoding in the sample script.
After implementing CLI, you don't need to edit the script.
Second, I introduce Grafical User Interface (GUI) to make the script more user-friendly.
Finally, I introduce web application so that users can the script without installation. All users have to do is connecting the Internet!

The timeline is supposed to be the following:

h1Introduction (3min)/h1


self-introduction
motivation of this talk
sample script (pathlib, Pillow)


h1CLI (5min)/h1


problem: need to edit the script
introduce argparse module (pass target file path from command line)

Docker has become a standard tool for developers around the world to deploy applications in a reproducible and robust manner. The existence of Docker and Docker compose have reduced the time needed to set up new software and implementing complex technology stacks for our applications. Now, six years after the initial release of Docker, we can say with confidence that containers and containers orchestration have become some of the defaults in the current technology stacks.

There are thousands of tutorials and getting started documents for those wanting to adopt Docker for apps deployment. However, if you are a Data Scientist, a researcher or someone working on scientific computing wanting to adopt Docker, the story is quite different. There are very few tutorials (in comparison to app/web) and documents focused on Docker best practices for DS and scientific computing. If you are working on DS, ML or scientific computing, this talk is for you. We'll cover best practices when building Docker containers for data-intensive applications, from optimising your image build, to ensuring your containers are secure and efficient deployment workflows. We will talk about the most common problems faced while using Docker with data intensive applications and how you can overcome most of them. Finally I'll give some practical and useful tips for you to improve your Docker workflows and practises.

Attendees will leave the talk feeling confident about adopting Docker across a range of DS, ML and research projects.

Who and Why (audience)
This talk is designed for folks working in data-intensive environments (i.e. Machine Learning, Data Science, research and scientific computing) and that are either using Docker or want to learn more about how to use Docker in these environments. Attendees will leave the talk feeling confident about adopting Docker in their workflows as well as have acquired several best practices and guidelines to do this robustly.

Android malware analysis engine is not a new story. Every antivirus company has their own secrets to build it. With python and curiosity, we develop a malware scoring system from the perspective of Taiwan Criminal Law in an easy but solid way.

We have an order theory of criminal which explains stages of committing a crime. For example, crime of murder consists of five stages, they are determined, conspiracy, preparation, start and practice. The latter the stage the more we’re sure that the crime is practiced.

According to the above principle, we developed our order theory of android malware. We develop five stages to see if the malicious activity is being practiced. They are

ol
Permission requested.
Native API call.
Certain combination of native API.
Calling sequence of native API.
APIs that handle the same register.
/ol

We not only define malicious activities and their stages but also develop weights and thresholds for calculating the threat level of a malware.

Malware evolved with new techniques to gain difficulties for reverse engineering. Obfuscation is one of the most commonly used techniques. In this talk, we present a Dalvik bytecode loader with the order theory of android malware to neglect certain cases of obfuscation.

Inspired by the design principles of the CPython interpreter, our Dalvik bytecode loader consists of functionalities such as 1. Finding cross-reference and calling sequence of the native API. 2. Tracing the bytecode register. The combination of these functionalities (yes, the order theory) not only can neglect obfuscation but also match perfectly to the design of our malware scoring system.

Further, we will also show a case study of Android malware and demonstrate how the obfuscation technique is useless to our engine. Last but not least, we will be open-sourcing everything (Malware Scoring System, Dalvik Bytecode Loader) during our presentation.

Audience
1. Who is this talk for?
- Anyone who's interested in cyber security or anyone that wants to know how to build an anti-virus engine with Python.

ol
What background knowledge or experience do you expect the audience to have?
A little of Android application development and malware analysis.
What do you expect the audience to learn or do after watching the talk?
The Dalvik bytecode loader is written as a python module, the audiences can use this module to boost up their malware analysis.
The malware scoring system can be applied not only to Android malware but also can be applied for PE files or ELF files in other OS. The audience can copy our ideas to extend their work.
Everything’s open-sourced.
/ol

Outline

ol
Introduction of Malware Scoring System.
First, we will detail how we decode Criminal Law to simple principles. For example, principles to define crime, penalty and the order theory of criminal, etc. And then we will detail how do we develop the order theory of android malware and other developed theories that construct the malware scoring.
Design Logic of the Dalvik Bytecode Loader.
Once the malware scoring system were built, this will discuss the design logic of our Dalvik bytecode loader which includes our obfuscation-neglect module and bytecode register tracing module. We will also detail why the order theory of android malware succeeds at neglecting the obfuscation.
Quark Engine Practice - Case Study of Android Malware
Next, we will practice our engine and case study through an android malware. Moreover, we will also demonstrate our obfuscation-neglect technique against obfuscation malware.
Future works
Here, we will discuss the limitations of our engine. For example, the challenge of our Dalvik bytecode loader. Also, we will share our plans of implementing more detection techniques conquering the escape detection of malware.

By Gajendra Deshpande

Imagine you are passing through an unknown street at midnight and you find that some anti-social elements are following you. To save yourself from them you start running and look for a safe place to hide. On the way, you will find a good person and requests him to help you. He hides you in his place to protect you. When these anti-social elements visit a good person’s place and enquire about you, the good person misguides them and redirects them to some other place in order to protect you. This is exactly how deception works. In this analogy, YOU are the resources to be protected, anti-social elements are the hackers who want to gain access to the resources, and a good person is a deception technique that protects the resources from hackers by making them fall in the trap.

The talk begins with an introduction to deception technology, deception types, and methods, a deceptive security life cycle. In this talk, we will demonstrate the following deception tools implemented using python language:
•   WebTrap (https://github.com/IllusiveNetworks-Labs/WebTrap): is designed to create deceptive webpages to deceive and redirect attackers away from real websites. The deceptive webpages are generated by cloning real websites, specifically their login pages.
•   DemonHunter (https://github.com/RevengeComing/DemonHunter):  is a distributed low interaction honeypot with Agent/Master design
Finally, we will conclude the talk with how built a deception tool and demonstrate its working. 

How we implemented a deception tool in python using machine learning:
We designed a deception tool in python language using PyBRAIN package to model and mitigate XPath injection attacks for web services. It is known that XML can be used to store the data and this data can be queried using XPath query language. XPath is a query language, it has injection issues similar to SQL. To handle this issue, we proposed a solution, which uses a count-based validation technique and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) modular neural networks to identify and classify atypical behavior in user input. Once the atypical user input is identified, the attacker is redirected to fake resources to protect the critical data. Our experiment resulted in over 90% accuracy in the classification of input vectors.

This is going to be a fun live-coding session using NumPy and SoundDevice. The goal of this talk is to make the computer produce realistic-sounding instrument sounds, using nothing but math.

All the code will be written live and we'll hear the audio that it produces.

We’ll start with creating a simple sound using a sine wave. We’ll gradually make it sound more like a real instrument, learning a little
bit about music theory on the way. We’ll add features one-by-one until by the end of the talk, we’ll hear our synthesizer play a piece
of classical music.

Discrete event simulation is a very powerful technique in many fields, like transport, warehousing, hospitals, manufacturing and logistics.
There are several commercial packages that provide high end GUIs to design a system and to animate the operations. These  packages are neary always close source and are very expensive (think USD 10-20 K per user). Often implementing complex algorithms is cumbersome.
On the other end of the spectrum are open source packages that use existing program languages. Python is particularly interesting because of the vast number of (scientific) packages, like machine learning, statistics and databases.
In te Python landscape there is SimPy, that is rather limited in functionality. In this poster I will present my discrete even simulation package called salabim. Salabim uses coroutines via generators and makes it very easy to model complex systems. The package offers advanced real time (2D) animation, monitoring and statistical sampling.
I will show some applications and how a simple model is built up.

By Dean Wampler

Ray (http://ray.io) is an open-source, distributed framework from U.C. Berkeley’s RISELab that easily scales Python applications from a laptop to a cluster. While broadly applicable, it was developed to solve the unique performance challenges of ML/AI systems, such as the heterogeneous task scheduling and state management required for hyperparameter tuning and model training, running simulations when training reinforcement learning (RL) models, and model serving. Ray is now used in many production deployments. 

I'll explain the problems that Ray solves for cluster-wide scaling of general Python applications and for specific examples, like RL workloads. Ray’s features include rapid scheduling and execution of “tasks” and management of distributed state, such as model parameters during training. I'll compare Ray to other libraries for distributed Python. 

This talk is for you if you need to scale your Python applications to a cluster and you want a robust, yet easy-to-use API to do it. You don't need to be a distributed systems expert to use Ray. You'll learn when to use Ray versus alternatives, how it’s used in several open source systems, and how to use it in your projects.

NLPeasy (https://github.com/d-one/NLPeasy) does that: Enrich the data using well-known pre-trained models (Word embeddings, Sentiment Analysics, POS, Dependency Parsing). Then start the Elastic Stack on your Docker. Set-up indices and ingest it in bulk. And finally generate Kibana dashboards to explore the results.

Complicated? Not at all! Just do it in a simple Jupyter Notebook.

In this presentation we will give an architecture overview of the different components and demonstrate the capabilities of this Python package.

Larger datasets can't fit into RAM - suddenly you can't use Pandas any more - but we need to analyse that data! First we'll review techniques to compress our data (maybe cutting our DataFrame RAM usage in half!) so we can process more rows using regular Pandas. Next we'll look at clever ways to make common operations run faster on DataFrames including dropping down to numpy, compiling with Numba and running multi-core. Finally for still-larger datasets we'll review Dask on Pandas and the new Vaex competitor solution. You'll leave with new techniques to make your DataFrames smaller and ideas for processing your data faster.
This talk is inspired by Ian's work updating his O'Reilly book High Performance Python to the 2nd edition for 2020. With over 10 years of evolution the Pandas DataFrame library has gained a huge amount of functionality and it is used by millions of Pythonistas - but the most obvious way to solve a task isn't always the fastest or most RAM efficient. This talk will help any Pandas user (beginner or beyond) process more data faster, making them more effective at their jobs.

Python is the lingua franca for data analytics and machine learning. Its superior productivity makes it the preferred tool for prototyping. However, traditional Python packages are not necessarily designed to provide high performance and scalability for large datasets.
From this talk you will learn how to get close-to-native performance with Intel-optimized packages, such as numpy, scipy, and scikit-learn. The next part of the talk is focused on getting high performance and scalability from multi-cores on a single machine to large clusters of workstations. It will be demonstrated that with Python it is possible to achieve the same performance and scalability as with hand-tuned C++/MPI code:
-   Scalable Dataframe Compiler (SDC) makes possible to efficiently load and process huge datasets using pandas/Python.
-   A convenient Python API to data analytics and machine learning primitives (daal4py). While its interface is scikit-learn-like, its MPI-based engine allows to scale machine learning algorithms to bare-metal cluster performance.
-   From the talk you will learn how to use SDC and daal4py together to build an end-to-end analytics pipeline that scales to clusters, requiring only minimal code changes.

By Sarah Gibson

As reproducibility gains traction in the data science and research communities, the need to package code, data and the computational environment is growing.

There are many tools that address different aspects of this type of packaging, such as Jupyter Notebooks for literate programming, Docker for containerising and porting computational environments, and so on. But they represent barriers to reproducibility as each one requires time and effort to learn.

Project Binder integrates Notebooks and Docker for generating reproducible computational analyses and combines them with a web-based interface and cloud orchestration engines. This means that analysts do not have to worry about all the moving parts so long as they have followed basic software best practices: their code is version controlled and they've captured the dependencies the analysis needs to run. Binder then hosts the compute in the cloud and makes it easily shareable by providing a unique URL to the code repository, without imposing additional overheads on the analyst.

During this talk, Sarah will introduce Binder (the service), BinderHub (the technological infrastructure) and mybinder.org (a public instance of a Binder service, free for anyone to use) and demonstrate how it can be used to share Python environments and analyses.

A lot of advancements are happening in the field of Deep Learning and Generative Adversarial Networks are one of them. We have seen GANs being applied for photo editing and in-painting, generating new image datasets and realistic photographs, increasing resolution of images (Super Resolution), and many more things. Some people have also exploited GANs for generating fake content. All the above-mentioned examples are result of a technique where the focus is to generate uncommon yet original samples from scratch. However, these examples have very less commercial applications and GANs are capable of doing much more. The focus of this talk is a technique called """"Neural Style Transfer (NST)"""" which has numerous commercial applications in the gaming world, fashion/design industry, mobile applications, and many more fields. Challenges and technicalities of NSTs will be covered in great detail. We will teach the machines on how to paint images and utilize Style Transfer networks to generate artistic artefacts.

Data cleaning is one of the most important tasks in data science but it is unglamorous, underappreciated and under-discussed. These are some common tasks involved in data cleaning but not limited to: 
-   Merging/ appending
-   Checking completeness of data
-   Checking of valid values
-   De-duplication
-   Handling of missing values
-   Recoding

Most, if not all, of the time, the datasets that we have to analyze are unclean. i.e. they are not necessarily complete/ accurate/ valid. This will impact the accuracy of our analysis if we do not clean them properly.

This talk covers how to perform data cleaning and understanding using primarily Pandas and Numpy. If you’re new to data analytics/ data science and are interested how to use Python to perform analysis, or if you're an Excel user hoping to move to Python, this talk might be for you.

Participants should be at least familiar with the basics of Python programming.

By Hongjoo Lee

As software engineers work on CI/CD process as soon as they start a new project, data scientists and ML engineers define a pipeline for data as it flows through a typical workflow. Each step of the pipeline is fed data processed from its preceding step as CI/CD process starts from code changes. 

""""Pipelining ML project"""" is sometimes misleading as it implies a large project with a group of engineers working on some large systems , being considered to be hard for an individual and unnecessary for a small project. Regardless of its size, having well organized pipelines for any ML projects is essential to succeed and actually it could be done easily with utilizing a proper tool.

In this talk, we will go through a machine learning workflow divided into a few steps composing a ML pipeline from data ingestion to model deployment. Each step depends on data produced by previous step, which are controlled by DVC. DVC is open-source version control system for data scientist and ML engineer helping them to organize data, models and experiments for some ML projects. The presentation will not only introduce how to use the tool but also show how to organize a ML pipeline with some examples. 

The goal of this talk is to motivate data scientists and ML engineer to start building machine learning pipeline with DVC. Audience might expect a guide to using DVC  for automating the pipeline. Also I will give some explanation about concepts of machine learning related techniques necessary for understanding the pipeline. 

This session is designed to be accessible to everyone in beginners level. Understandings of basic concepts of machine learning and version control system (preferably, Git) might be helpful but not mandatory for the audience.

During the pandemic lockdown of COVID-19, we found a very different context from the usual: a) students with much more time available for learning b) many students who did not have a personal computer and could only access classes by cell phone c) difficulty to realistically assess learning. In this lecture we will present the real experiences in a traditional programming course given during the Covid-19 pandemic.

By Elizaveta Shashkova

Many people like Python for its simplicity and beauty. But every statement in Python, even the simple one, produces a lot of events during the program execution. These events are usually hidden from a user, so it helps developers to skip low-level implementation details and focus on bigger things.

At the same time many parts of this hidden information are very useful and interesting to examine. The good news is that Python Runtime allows to retrieve it really simply, so there is no need to configure additional libraries or pass additional parameters to interpreter. Everybody can do it right inside their Python code.

During this talk we will learn how Python allows to inspect current program state during the execution. We will learn about Python variables, frame objects and useful information they store. After that we will discuss several powerful tools which are based on the runtime information and which can be helpful for any Python programmer in their everyday life.

Async is all the rage, mostly because it simplifies waiting for an operation that takes some time to finish. Python went all in on asyncio by changing the language to support it (async/await) iIn this microservices era where many of the applications we develop consume several 3rd party API services, async is the fast track to success. In this talk, I’ll demonstrate the benefits of going async for a web application, justify choosing Sanic over other web frameworks like aiohttp. I’ll do so by transforming a Flask backed application to a Sanic backed application. Finally, I’ll provide tips &amp; tricks from my experience on measuring, monitoring and testing async code.

EuroPython 2020 - Talk - 2020-07-24 - Ni
Online

By Cheuk Ho

Query language is an important part of a database system, it is how people manage their data and how they can make the data useful to them. Starting from the 70s, the world is full of relational databases and SQL was the way to make queries. However, SQL is valuable to an injection attack. Lots of efforts are being used to stop those attacks and it made workflow become less efficient.

We don’t want to make the same mistake. That’s why using a Python query language is good. Having the Python community in our mind, we created WOQLpy, an open-source query language that lets users build queries in Python, instead of JSON-LD which is the native query language for our TerminusDB database. Now users can store data with a knowledge graph and make graph data visualization with Python.

In the first part of the talk, we will talk about what challenges we have when creating a query language in Python, the method we use, the idea and theory behind, and how WOQLpy work. This part will include a quick live demo of using WOQLpy so audiences can have an impression on how to make a query and get the task done, that is, getting a meaningful graph visualization form the source CSVs. The process of how to create a database and schema, loading the data form many CSVs, making a query and visualization, will be demonstrated using just one python script.

In the second part of the talk, we want to stimulate a discussion of what is a good design in Python and what is not. This part will be more interactive with the audiences, as we want to hear from you all, what would be the best for Pythonistas. By first suggesting some possible design, we will use a live voting system to gather opinions. This part of the talk will extend to the Q &amp; A sessions to allow further discussions.

This talk is for Pythonista at all levels who are interested in starting to design a package in Python, no matter if the audience has published a python library or not. By attending this talk, audiences will learn about how to design a Python package that will be useful to Pythonistas and hopefully encourage more people to publish open-source packages online.

In this talk I am going to present possible approaches for a Python 3 migration of existing Python code running on Python 2.7. I'll evaluate which of these approaches seems suitable for a large code base and which principles should be paid attention to to increase the probability of a successful migration project.

I'll use union.cms (a content management system used by German trade unions) to show the story of a successful migration project involving nearly one million lines of Python code. The story will include the obstacles we encountered and what we learned on the way.

I believe that most of the discussed ideas and experience can also be used unchanged in smaller projects as the presented principles are very much the same.

Goal of the presentation: You should be able to come up with a plan for migrating your Python 2 based projects to Python 3.

Abstractions make things appear simple. This is one of the main concepts behind OOP. So what is it?! This talk will provide some guidelines on how to build abstractions that are extendable and scalable. 

I will start by bringing audience on same page, I will explain what are abstractions in programming with some examples, I will also compare what are strong and weak abstractions and also give some examples. Later on I will talk a bit about leaky abstractions and provide some examples. 

After brining audience to the same page I would switch focus to actual topic by talking about how bad abstractions are formed and then have a quick interactive session where I will show audience some interfaces and ask them to tell which abstraction is better and also bitch about the wrong things in the bad ones. After having good understanding of what makes abstractions bad, I would explain you various design pattern by doing post mortem of the python redis client. Lastly if you have any questions I would be happy to answer them.

By Tam-Sanh Nguyen

The goal of this talk is to introduce data pipeline developers to QuantumBlack's approach for keeping data pipelines healthy and sustainable and facilitating collaboration between data scientists and data engineers by using our open source framework, Kedro. Attendees need between novice and intermediate knowledge of Python (enough to understand syntactic sugar and funargs) in order to appreciate this talk.

As data continues to inform more and more business strategy, high quality, fully featured data pipelines have never been more critical. Small data scripts and single-coder science projects are not enough to keep up with the pace of day-to-day business and their ever-growing list of requirements. Now, more than ever, we need data engineers and data scientists to collaborate effectively. Yet, these two parties come with inherently competing needs.

Data scientists need high data volatility and parameterization, for experimentation, and data engineers, on the other hand, need stability and performance, to deliver data. Furthermore, as pipelines grow, the cost of knowledge transfer and training new team members also increases. How can we get scientists and engineers to work well together, and sustain pipeline growth as the team also grows?

For this, QuantumBlack created Kedro, a framework for writing data pipelines that addresses both the needs for flexibility and stability in its features and patterns of use. By using Kedro’s tools and operating model, we have enabled our teams to scale our single-developer, micro-pipes to industrial sized data processors with dozens of developers; all without sacrificing readability, quality, or stability. This talk will show you how.

Online

By Alexander Hultnér

The goal with this talk is to introduce the audience to property-based testing for API’s using schemas to automatically generate test scenarios, enabling them to write more powerful tests faster. 

The talk will focus on a subset of the field of property-based testing where we focus on testing by automatically generating properties and test strategies from the API Schemas that we often already have. These tests ensure that our APIs conform to their specified schema and enables us to write a much larger amount of tests in less time. 

I will focus on the schemathesis library which leverages the strong hypothesis library as well as the hypothesis-JSONSchema extension strategies, and will in the future also support GraphQL via the hypothesis-graphql strategies. I’m a contributor to schemathesis and currently working on the future GraphQL support with schemathesis creator, Dmitry Dygalo. 

I will also compare it with its predecessor “swagger-conformance”, pure property-based testing through hypothesis, schema strategies with hypothesis-graphql and hypothesis-jsonschema, and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. I will also briefly talk about “QuickREST: Property-based Test Generation of OpenAPI-Described RESTful APIs” (https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09686), the research paper that’s part of the inspiration for these tools. 

By focusing on property-based test generation using schemas we already have, I will show that a field like property-based testing, which can seem quite daunting at first, actually can have a low barrier to entry while yielding large amounts of value in return and is useful for most common web projects today. 

The talk will show how formal schemas for APIs can and will continue to provide additional value outside the scope of documentation.

By Miloslav Pojman

HTTP is the foundation of the current web, and HTTP/3 is the upcoming major version of it. The new version is built on top of the QUIC transport protocol, originally developed in Google.

HTTP/3 can change the Internet as we know it today. Since its beginning in the 90s, HTTP transfers data over TCP to ensure reliable connections between clients and servers. QUIC is a TCP alternative, reimplemented on top of unreliable and connectionless UDP.

Proprietary Google implementation of QUIC is deployed worldwide and supported by Chrome browsers. Future HTTP/3 will be hopefully standardized by IETF soon, but many diverse implementations are available already today.

HTTP/3 improves performance and increases privacy. The switch from TCP to QUIC allows us to address the inherent limitations of previous HTTP versions. The QUIC protocol is completely encrypted, including traffic control headers, which are visible in TCP. 

This talk introduces HTTP/3 and the underlaying QUIC protocol. It shows both advantages and disadvantages of the new technology, and it describes the landscape of the current implementations and suggests what you can try today.

EuroPython 2020 - Talk - 2020-07-24 - Parrot Data Science

By Nicolas Kuhaupt

In time series forecasting we are interested in how the time series is going to continue in the future. This is of high importance in areas like forecasting energy production from renewable resources, forecasting demand of customers or the price of products. Many forecasting algorithms provide only the prediction. However, oftentimes we are also interested in the likelihood of the prediction and how much it may vary. This is what probabilistic forecasting is for. With every forecast, we also obtain an upper and lower bound with certain probabilities. For a long time, probabilistic forecasting was limited to traditional techniques like ARIMA. DeepAR is an algorithm that allows us to combine Deep Learning techniques with probabilistic forecasting. Additionally, in contrast to training a model for each time series individually, DeepAR suggests training one large forecasting model for all related time series. The algorithm was developed by Amazon and is also provided in AWS SageMaker. 
In this talk, we will understand the theoretical basics of DeepAR, have a look at a practical time series example and will demonstrate an implementation. In the end, you will be prepared to get started with your own forecasts.

Online

By Alexander Condello

In the past, quantum computing was largely reserved for researchers, physicists, and scientists with direct access to physical quantum computing systems. But the game has changed, thanks to the cloud. Barriers to quantum computing are coming down quickly.

Today, cloud access (like D-Wave’s Leap 2 quantum application environment) and improvements in quantum computing hardware, software, and developer tools are allowing programmers around the world to code on live quantum computers in real-time. Developers, students, and researchers around the world can now tap into the power of a quantum via their browser — quantum mechanical knowledge not required. Users and private companies have already built over 200 early applications on D-Wave’s computers in industries ranging from automotive to machine learning, aerospace, finance, and beyond. The quantum application era is here, and the growing quantum developer community is making it a reality.

In this session, Alex Condello, Manager of Applications Development Technology and Tools at D-Wave Systems, will talk about the burgeoning quantum application development ecosystem, and how developers can start learning to code on a quantum computer today. This includes a walkthrough of Leap 2, D-Wave's new quantum cloud service equipped with hybrid solvers, and D-Wave's Ocean SDK. Alex will also explore some of the early applications that developers and companies have built to-date.

EuroPython 2020 - Poster session - 2020-07-24 - Poster 1
Online

By Francesca Tedeschi

This project contains an open source Python library for image reconstruction in Axial Computed Tomography (TAC), based on the analytical Radon transforms of some classes of phantoms. 
The package is available on GitHub at the following address: https://github.com/francescat93/Exact_sinogram.
The mathematical phantoms are fictitious images, composed of very simple geometric figures (ellipses, squares and rectangles) that, sampled with the Radon transform allows to build a fictitious signal, called (exact) sinogram.  Using a phantom gives the advantage to test the reconstruction algorithm on a zero-noise data so the error we get is only due to numerical inaccuracies in the algorithm itself. We want to calculate two reconstructed images from the approximated and exact sinograms, obtained applying the iradon function of the Python library scikit-image on both of them. We expect a smaller error on the exact reconstructed image. This turns to be true on continuous regions, but near the discontinuities of the phantom the Gibbs phenomenon prevents us to obtain the same enhancement.

EuroPython 2020 - Talk - 2020-07-24 - Microsoft
Online

By Camila Maia

In the current IT scenario, the use of APIs is, without question, widely vast, popular, and significant. It seems at least prudent to ensure they are working properly, as expected. To guarantee the quality of the data that is being consumed or used. To ensure that communication between services is occurring as expected. To ensure the system does, in fact, what it should do.

ScanAPI is an open-source library that was created to solve all these points. ScanAPI provides an easy way to create integration tests for REST APIs via configuration files.

The three main reasons that led me to the creation of this library were:

ol
To be a firefighter in a scenario where most of the reported bugs were directly related to some API contract being broken or some endpoint having a behavior different from that expected by the consumer.
To need to deal with APIs with outdated or mistaken documentation.
To need to debug an endpoint in the middle of a """"chain"""" of other endpoints. Where I needed to recreate a state that depends on the action of other endpoints.
/ol

Given a fictitious example: debug an endpoint to reserve seats on an airplane, which depends directly on the previous call of an endpoint for user registration.

The ScanAPI is open-source and written in Python. However, it can be used in APIs created in any other programming language, since the tests provided by it are integration tests.

With ScanAPI you can:


Use environment variables
Create variables
Chaining requests - making a request from a result of previous responses
Hide sensitive information of the requests and responses in the generated report
Write Python code - if you want, it's not necessary :)


Topics I intend to address in this talk:


Motivation to create the library
What problems the library solves
How to test an API using a ScanAPI
Show the documentation generated by ScanAPI
An overview of how it is implemented
Where it is currently being used
Next steps


Project Link: https://github.com/scanapi/scanapi

Prerequisites:
- Python
- REST APIs
- Integration tests

Great, you've developed a great web API. Awesome, you are about to deploy it. But, how do you secure it and manage access?

Learn about different approaches to securing a web API whether it is meant for third-party integrations or driving a modern single-page application. Not all APIs are the same, so we will explore different considerations to make when crafting a solution to handle token-based authentication, and scoping to define access levels.

As one of the core developers of the async web framework Sanic, I will primarily focus on authentication and authorization tools inside Sanic to showcase how to address these issues. However, the concepts should be broadly applicable enough to take back and apply to any web API. The goal is to learn the hot spots, and identify strategies to overcome them.

Core take aways will include:
- how to implement various JWT strategies;
- best practices for storing JWTs on a browser; and
- controlling access privileges using structured scopes.

Time permitting, we will even discuss some tools to be used to help ease the anxiety and make security more approachable.

By Lilian Nandi

Our generation of young people in school (aged 5-18) have noticed the connection between Computer pRogramming, Technology, Success and Billionaires. On mass they are clamouring to master the skill of Computer pRogramming. It  has been dubbed the ‘4th’ R’ (computer pRogramming) along with Reading, wRiting and aRithmetic. So, governments worldwide have launched initiatives to have it taught in schools from Kindergarten to all the way to high school.

So, how do we best teach and motivate the next generation in acquiring this skill?

We describe a successful working model for the teaching of Computer pRogamming. We have been building upon this model for a couple of years now.  Last year at EuroPython 2019 in Basel, we spoke about this subject and this year we would like to share more findings with the Python community about what we are learning about the teaching of Computer Programming to children and young people.

The talk will describe a case study whereby computer programming (Python) was introduced to a group of 110 young people from the ages of 11 to 18, in a U.K secondary school. The talk will include descriptions of the various teaching methodologies &amp; the outcomes; &amp; the challenges involved. The talk will conclude with helpful suggestions, on how to proceed in this area.

By Reuven Lerner

Sorting is one of those things that we take for granted in Python. The built-in """"sorted"""" function knows how to sort any iterable of objects that are themselves sortable.

But hiding behind that simple description is a great deal of depth. In this talk, I'll go deep into what it means to sort, and how we can sort any collection of Python data.  We'll see how you can use custom functions to sort built-in data structures in new and interesting ways.  And we'll see how you can design your own custom classes such that they will sort in just the way you want.

After watching this talk, you'll have a better understanding of sorting, built-in data structures, function objects, and how """"magic methods"""" affect the our Python classes.  Moreover, you'll be able to write clearer, shorter, and more easily understood code.

Topics I'll address in this talk:


""""sorted"""" and Timsort
Sorting a list of simple structures
Reversing the direction with """"reverse""""
Custom sorting with """"key""""
Stable sort
Sorting a list of dicts
Using """"lambda""""
Using operator.itemgetter
Sorting a list of named tuples
Sorting a list of objects
Making your object sortable
The functools.total_ordering decorator


This is an intermediate-level talk; I'll assume that anyone attending knows how to write functions, classes, and methods.

MongoDB is webscale, right? It's a JSON database, it's eventually consistent, and you use map-reduce to query it. Oh, and it's insecure.

Let me clear up some things: MongoDB is an ACID-compliant database with transactions, schemas &amp; relationships. It includes a powerful aggregation query language; map-reduce has been deprecated for some time now. MongoDB doesn't speak or store JSON, and nowadays it comes with pretty good security defaults (we think).

There are many myths around about MongoDB - what it is, how it works, and what it does wrong. Like any database product, you need to know its capabilities and how to get the best out of it. On top of this, the product has changed ema lot/em over the years, but lots of information out there hasn't caught up.

I'll cover 8 myths around MongoDB, explain how they're wrong, why the myth originated in the first place (some of them weren't originally myths).


What exactly emis/em MongoDB?
What is the current release of MongoDB?
MongoDB is emnot/em a JSON database.
MongoDB emhas/em transactions.
MongoDB allows relationships.
You should only consider sharding if you emmust/em.
MongoDB emis secure/em.
MongoDB stores your data reliably.
MongoDB is a big product, with lots to learn.


Along the way, I'll explain some of MongoDB's best-kept secrets, and provide practical tips and tricks for using it. The audience will leave with a good idea of what MongoDB is, what it isn't, and how to best develop with it.

Since we wanted to support the community even in difficult times, we decided to go for the online version -- even though this would be much less engaging than the in-person event.

For the past months, we have been creating a concept for the conference from scratch. The talk will present our approach, how it came to be and which challenges we faced. The concept should be usable by other conference as well.

Many of us are using Kubernetes in production. A Kubernetes Operator is a way to automate packaging, deploying, and managing of a Kubernetes Application. It is a software alternative to a human operator who has deep knowledge of how to set up, deploy, and manage a particular piece of infrastructure and what to do if it isn’t behaving correctly. Let’s see how we can automate all of this while staying in the Python ecosystem.

It will be helpful to know some basic concepts of Kubernetes(Deployments, Services, Pods, Configmap etc.) and Celery(docs.celeryproject.org) to get the most out of this talk.

Talk is divided into four phases.

Phase I - Problems and Opportunities
We're going to see some simple examples/problems where a lot of manual effort is involved so as to connect audience to the problem.
We're going to discuss problems with configuration management, database cluster setup and introduce the focus problem of the talk which is around automating the setup of a Celery cluster.

Phase II - Incrementally Approaching the Solution
We're going to incrementally approach the automation each of the manual steps involved in running a Celery cluster in Production. We're going to discuss the extension capabilities in Kubernetes using CRDs and Custom Controllers which are going to help us manage our Celery cluster automagically.

Phase III - Celery Operator in action
We're going to see the code of custom controller and the whole operator in action. We create the newly defined celery resource and see how the operator works on bringing up the worker and flower deployments and handles autoscaling based on queue length.

Phase IV - Conclusion and Q&amp;A
We're going to talk about different use-cases and what is world doing with Operators. We'll discuss the next steps for the Celery operator and some resources to help build operators. We'll end the talk with a Q&amp;A.

The Corona Virus - COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant impact on public services. In particular, it brought a massive digitalization of services that were offered in person. In addition, there was a great deal of pressure on official channels, whether to seek a service or to report a fact. Qualified and official information becomes an element in combating the pandemic. Knowing where to look for information, reporting a fact or getting a qualified response are essential steps to maximize the efficiency of the citizen's decision-making process, especially in a scenario of such uncertainty. The State has a fundamental role, whether as an inducer, executor or provider of the means necessary for information and decision-making to be effective at that time.
Connected by the growing demand, the State of Goiás, through the State's Comptroller General, published a series of technological tools with the objective of bringing information to the citizen, promoting social control and improving public policies to fight the Coronavirus.
This document seeks to show how technological tools were adopted and implemented in terms of transforming the ombudsman channels in the State of Goiás through the State's Comptroller General in actions to combat the Coronavirus pandemic. The document seeks to show how the transformation of the ombudsman channels occurred through machine learning techniques and data visualization.

The first is having a culture of collaboration – and this means collaboration across individuals, across departments, and across teams – really - it’s a culture that’s less about competition and cutthroat political systems.. And more about helping each other achieve the extraordinary.

The second quality is organizations that treat and expect their employees to act like owners. Owning not just their behaviors, actions, and responsibilities, but owning outcomes and becoming a voice for the organization.

No matter where your organization is at today, the good news is– there are proven strategies to create a culture of collaborative ownership at your organization and that’s what I’m going to teach you in this course.

I’ll share how you can build momentum from a carefully crafted vision and goals, I’ll help you improve communication and drive ownership, I’ll help you foster creativity, and finally, I’ll help you train up leaders in your organization and help you meet more of your goals.

So, if you’re ready to transform your organization. let’s go!

LEARNING OBJECTIVES:

Attendees will learn: How to transform a command-obey dynamic to one of creativity and innovation through opportunities for ownership. How to collaborate with opportunities for ownership through proven methods to increase connectivity and engagement in the team. How to foster captainship within your organization. How to apply the ideas of collaborative ownership specifically in individual organizations.

SESSION OUTLINE: Fostering an Ownership Culture (Creativity and Innovation)- Ownership Activity -Fostering a Collaborative Culture- Collaborative Activity - Fostering Captainship Culture - Captainship activity- The Application of Collaborative Ownership for Personal and Organizational Success- Applying Collaborative Ownership to Organizations and Self Activity -Conclusion Q&amp;A

This has been mitigated with tooling and education, but for the most part it requires human action and decision. While most codebases have somewhere between tens and thousands of Python modules, some companies may maintain a codebase with millions of modules. This presentation covers techniques and tooling that Google created to enable the developers to scope their migration needs, plan the work required, execute effectively at scale and collaborate across teams/dependencies.

By Stefan Baerisch

What do we do when the only test requirements we have are """"the new system should have the exact same results as the old system""""? Golden Master Testing may help.
The idea behind golden master testing, also called characterization testing, is quite simple: We don't write test cases that specify what the expected result is. Instead, we take the output from a prior, working version of a program (the golden master) and compare it to the result of the current version. If there is a difference between the output of the current system and the golden master, we may have found a bug.

If implemented right, Golden Master testing can be very useful to test legacy systems or data processing programs with complex input and outputs. Golden Master Testing is also a good addition to our regression testing processes.

In practice, implementing Golden Master testing is not quite that easy.  Just checking if the outputs are equal will often not work: If the output includes times and dates or random elements, a simple comparison will not be enough. Luckily for use, with Python, we have the perfect tool to process all kinds of outputs and only look at the parts of the output that are important for the outcome of the test.

In this talk, we will look at best practices for Golden Master Testing with Python. We will see techniques to identify and quantify the relevant differences between our golden master and the current output.

This talk will describe how Gousto, a leading recipe box service based in the UK, is using python to build a personalisation ecosystem. Our menu planning optimisation algorithm allows us to create the perfect mix of recipes, ensuring a variety of dish types, cuisines and ingredients. Our recommendation engine sitting on top of this can then offer each customer a personally curated menu, making sure that users have meaningful choice. All this while ensuring that we are also optimising for maximum performance from the operations point of view! 

To build this, we have used a range of Python packages, such as DEAP for implementing genetic algorithms, and integrations, such as the one for graph database neo4j. 

The talk will give an overview of our methods, our infrastructure, our results and everything that we have learnt along the way!

By Theofanis Petkos, George Zisopoulos

Undoubtedly this will be the decade of low-cost and high-performance cloud IoT core development.
All cloud IoT solutions will have to meet the same two fundamental requirements: Performance and Data Integrity. Having said that,  AsyncIO comes to mind.
While researching similar topics on cloud IoT solutions, we noticed that the vast majority of such solutions primarily includes performance. In this discussion we would like to demonstrate how you can ensure that a low-cost, fast developed cloud IoT core can ensure that its data is not corrupted and is accurate  for the user.
Technically speaking, it is very interesting to analyze how a bucket of async/await tasks can handle (consume or even produce) messages from or to message queues, interact with other (even non pythonic) modules inside the core, manage socket connections and many other functionalities that make Python3.6+ the heart of any IoT core. Note that it is equally important to check imported data with periodic tasks, acquire statistics from devices and sanitize database data in order to ensure data integrity.
Our goal: Firstly, to encourage new developers to get involved with cloud IoT cores and use Python and AsyncIO as the heart of their core. Secondly, as new developers we would like to show our logic and our prefered python libraries and techniques in order to receive feedback from more experienced developers.
We are a team of software engineers located in Athens, Greece working for a fast growing startup in San Francisco (https://www.veturilo.io). We have developed our own cloud IoT core for a vehicle fleet management SaaS.

Like other programming languages, it is easy to write cryptic, unmaintainable, and rigid Python code. Moreover, in teams, this problem escalates due to varied coding styles of developers. How to ensure code quality and consistency? My goal with this talk is to educate my audience about some tools and libraries that can help us in making our code more consistent. 
I was a Software Engineer who wrote Automation systems in Python for some of the fortune 500s. I intend to cover the following major ideas:
•   What is a high-quality code? How consistency is an important aspect of maintainability?
•   Ways to achieve consistency in Python
    o   What is PEP8?
    o   “pylint” - a source code, bug, and quality checker for python       and follows the style recommended by PEP 8
    o   What is PEP257? 
    o   “pydocstyle” checks compliance with Python docstring conventions.
    o   What is PEP484? 
    o   “mypy” provides optional static type checking.
    o   “bandit” which can find common security issues in Python code.
    o   “black” which is a Python source code formatter.
•   Ways to integrate mentioned tools in development life cycle 
    o   While writing (IDE extensions)
    o   During commit (pre-commit hooks)
    o   After push (Build pipelines)
•   “pre-commit” is a framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks
•   Example of an Azure DevOps pipeline integrating all mentioned tools.
pylint, pydocstyle, mypy, bandit, black and pre-commit are available on PyPI. My audience should know how to install Python libraries from PyPi using pip.

Packaging in Python is hard. Packaging is particularly hard when code needs to run in a distributed computing environment where it is difficult to know what runs where and which parts of the code are available to run there. 

In this talk we will present different ways to ship Python code to a compute cluster, what Python's """"pickling"""" feature has to do with this, what self contained executables are and the challenges we met when shipping Python code to a cluster with 1000s of nodes running 1000s of jobs like TensorFlow or Spark.

As an example, we will show how one can run a PySpark job on top of S3 storage using PEX as a self contained executable artifact. Finally we will explain how those ideas generalize for different Jobs (like Tensorflow, Dask), different virtual environments (like Anaconda or vanilla Python virtual envs) and different distributed storage's (like S3 or HDFS). 

The auditor will get an overview of the challenges of Python packaging for distributed applications and see code samples that can be applied in his own project.

The technology is to take script written in a high-level language (Python), analyze its inputs/outputs, images or graphs display, other interactions with the user and build connectors to this script from Chat Apps like Slack, Skype, and others. Imagine that you described your skill as a script and gave it to a software robot. And from that moment it is his skill, you and your colleagues can ask him any time to run this skill and give results. As a script author, you don't think about how to connect with different Chat Apps, how to control access, how to monitor that script works fine when colleagues run it, how to save logs, how to balance load if there are too many colleagues running script and so on, our platform does all of this so the author doesn't need to think about what is that software robot, how it works, the platform will understand script by itself. The author just drop script to the platform and tell to the platform which colleagues have the right to run this script.

For whom?

For teams who are in charge of Servers, Applications, API's, Data Bases, Analytical reports and other information technology items.

For tasks like


to fetch diagnostic information from multiple data sources into Chat App, gather metrics/logs and analyzing them
to take an action in case of incident right from a Chat App, rerouting users requests, server rebooting, launching new instances, and many other actions
to give easy access via Chat App to APIs for team members and other coleagues
to provide analytical reports by the request from Chat App, reports with graphs, images, tables, files, etc.


These things are trivial to automate and share, you can do much more with Python, Chat App and smart script sharing platform.

Identified in December 2019, the novel Coronavirus has infected 2.7 million worldwide, and claimed the lives of 0.2 million. Amidst this deadly pandemic, I started my open source project, Corona-Net, in the hopes of contributing to the global fight against the Coronavirus. Corona-Net is a 3-part project dedicated to the classification, binary segmentation and multi-class segmentation of COVID-19. I first leverage the EfficientNet model for COVID-19 diagnosis, then utilise and refine the U-Net architecture for both binary and 3-class (ground-glass, consolidation, pleural effusion) segmentation of COVID-19 symptoms, through inference on the COVID-19 CT segmentation (chest axial CT) dataset. Through Corona-Net, I aim to develop a reliable, visual-semantically balanced method for automatic COVID-19 diagnosis, as well as extend an invitation to all to collaborate and stand together against this pandemic. My PyTorch code is publicly available at https://github.com/chinglamchoi/Corona-Net.

Imagine this school scenario: an entire year group of students aged 11-12, the majority completely new to coding, undergoing 6 hours of compulsory lessons on Python for Scientific Computing.    

Now imagine these outcomes: br /
•   Students wanting to continue coding from the lessons outside of class in their own time br /
•   Students asking to replicate the lesson computing environment at home br /
•   Students disappointed for the lessons to come to an end and asking for more br /
•   Students struggling in Science discovering intrinsic ability in computing, bringing new enjoyment and confidence     

And lastly, imagine that all the students are girls!     

This talk will share this actual case study of a pioneering Python education initiative implemented at a secondary school for girls in London, UK for a cohort of 120 students.     

The audience will gain actionable insights of the factors that enabled these children to develop basic but working proficiency of a mainstream scientific data stack using typical school IT resources.    

Ultimately, this talk aims to increase awareness of Scientific Computing &amp; Data Science as potentially effective and empowering Python education for young people.

Purpose: We have established a legal entity to make it easier to manage money and contracts for PyCon JP event 
I have been a director since 2013

2014-1016: Chair od PyCon JP event
I was the chair of PyCon JP event from 2014 to 2016
Purpose: Open management
I opened every staff meeting to make it easier for new staff to join
We created an operation manual and made it reusable
We regularly publish our activities on the blog to get interested in event management

2015-: PyCon mini
Small PyCons in the region were held in Sapporo and Hiroshima in 2015
It has been held in various places such as Kumamoto and Osaka
PyCon Kyushu is held all over Kyushu(Fukuoka - Okinawa - Kumamoto)
We have been sharing operating know-how and supporting money and people
We have also provided a subdomain of pycon.jp

2016-: Python Boot Camp
Objective: We visit all over Japan to teach Python → We connect with local people → We hope local communities to start up
We teach an introduction to Python programming in half a day
We hold 40 times in 3.5 years with 950 local participants
We hold in cooperation with local staff and local teachig assistants
Result: Some local communities have been created
PyCon JP has more people coming from local area

2019: Python Boot Camp Caravan, Regional Meetup

Purpose: To strengthen the connection between local communities
A regional meetup was held at PyCon JP 2019 with local community members
About 30 people gathered from all over Japan for this event
We had various discussions and shared ideas and worries
We hold local meetups online

EuroPython 2020 - Talk - 2020-07-24 - Brian

By Serge Sans Paille

In spite of the dynamic nature of their favorite language, some Python developer have a huge desire to statically analyse it. This can indeed be useful for linters, type inference, auto-completion and all the tooling some developers expect from modern IDE.
We all know that lazy binding prevents even the simplest function call or attribute lookup to be reliably analyzed. Yet we try. And Python as this fabulous codeast/code module, saving us from writing a parser! Isn't that a strong incentive to do static analysis?

This talk presents two modules developers can build upon to build such analyzers:

precode- gast, a generalization of the Python AST that provides a common API for all the variant of the Python AST, from python 2.7 to Python 3.8
- beniget, an analyzer of the Python AST (built upon gast) that provides a useful and well-known abstraction to understand programs: use-def chains
/code/pre

Built upon these two modules, memestra is a static analyzer of deprecated function calls, developed in partnership with QuantStack. A tool which, given a module, reports any use of deprecated APIs. Let's explore how such a module can be built and unveil the mysteries of static analysis.

This is a small code snippet that I have written in Python for the POC of getting the GPS coordinate from android phone:

import time 
from bottle import Bottle, run, response, request 

app = Bottle() 
droid = androidhelper.Android()

if not current_location: 
    current_location = droid.getLastKnownLocation().result 

droid.stopLocating()

return json.dumps( 
     
        """"result"""": current_location 
    , indent=4 
)
/code/pre

This project was initiated during my Christmas vacation, inspired by Android Barcode Scanner as I was looking on the solution that I could catalogue my books by scanning the ISBN using android phone.

This quick solution did save me enormous amount of time in cataloguing my books. Intriguing by the design of APIs that can interact with android intents, I decided to dig further to understand how the APIs works. In concept, there is an RPC call between android app and python interpreter within the app that acts as a bridge, which allows python APIs to trigger Android intents, upon calling related APIs. For example, using the code snippet above, when Python GPS API is executed, the API will send request to Android GPS intent via the RPC call. Once Android intent receives the request, it will grab the GPS data, and passes the GPS data back to Python GPS API through the same channel.

Most of us work too much and play too little.  When was the last time you smiled at something you made?  Playing with fun datasets, especially big data sets, opens up weird new forms of technical recreation.  Why not train an amusing model in a browser tab while you're waiting for that day-job Spark query to finish?  I'll show you some data toys I've built using AI and interesting data sets: Most of them involve both backend data science and front-end visualization tricks.  They range from poetry-composition helpers to game log analysis to image deconstruction and reconstruction. All of them taught me something, often about myself and what I like artistically, and sometimes about what """"big data"""" actually means.

[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-10 - Shanghai]
[Basel, CH]

By Sebastian Witowski

I've been programming in Python for over 7 years. And from the time someone introduced me to IPython, it immediately became my default Python REPL. I enjoyed the syntax highlighting, code completion or the instant access to the documentation. Over the years, I've picked up more and more tricks that IPython could do: embedding IPython sessions, starting IPython automatically when a test fails, taking advantage of the startup files, not to mention all the various magic functions.

It took me some time to discover all those features (if there is one thing I would like you to take away from this talk, it’s that reading the documentation of a tool that you are using emevery day/em is probably a good idea) and in this talk, I will give an overview of what you can do with IPython REPL.

Some of the things I will talk about:
- Documentation with ? and ??, running shell functions in IPython, magic functions
- Profiles, startup files, configuration file, kernels, and extensions
- How to better use IPython for debugging
- How to use IPython for profiling
- Alternatives to IPython REPL

This talk is for you if you are a casual user of IPython - you know some of its features, but maybe not all of them and instead of reading through the documentation, you would prefer to see someone giving an overview of IPython features and how you can use them.

This talk is NOT for you if you are up to date with IPython documentation and you think you know most of its features.

How recommendation engines are taking part in our daily routine and how companies as Netflix and Amazon implement it?
This talk aims to show the elements that compound a recommendation engine to people who have never been in touch with the matter or want to know a bit more. At the end of this session, you might be able to reproduce your own recommendation system and also know where to find more about it.

Talk structure: 
1. What is and why use a recommendation engine? 
2. Recommendation engine importance 
3. Steps of a recommendation 
4. Recommendation algorithms 
5. Basic Statistics for distance and correlation 
6. Example

Both Python and Rust are getting more and more popularity. Although it is unfair to compare them directly, this talk aims to provide a clear comparison with a pre-defined criteria applied to a specific use-case. 
Writing a simulation engine is very similar to writing a game engine and requires certain features from a language or framework.
Possible comparison criteria: 
1. Performance
2. Simplicity
3. Amount of code necessary for a MVP
4. Utilities: docs, tests, profile
5. Compatibility

[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-10 - Singapore [PyData track]
[Basel, CH]

By Paolo Galeone

AutoGraph is one of the most exciting new features of Tensorflow 2.0: it allows transforming a subset of Python syntax into its portable, high-performance and language agnostic graph representation bridging the gap between Tensorflow 1.x and the 2.0 release based on eager execution.

Using AutoGraph with the code@tf.fuction/code decorator seems easy, but in practice, writing efficient and correctly graph-convertible code requires to know in detail how AutoGraph and tf.function work.

In particular, knowing how:


A graph is created and when it is re-used;
To deal with functions that create a state;
To correctly use the Tensorflow codetf.Tensor/code object instead of using the Python native types to speed-up the computation;


defines the minimum skill-set required to write correct graph-accelerable code.

The talk will guide you trough AutoGraph and codetf.function/code highlighting all the peculiarities that are worth knowing to build the right skill-set.

By Gael Varoquaux

According to industry surveys [1], the number one hassle of data scientists is cleaning the data to analyze it. Textbook statistical modeling is sufficient for noisy signals, but errors of a discrete nature break standard tools of machine learning. I will discuss how to easily run machine learning on data tables with two common dirty-data problems: missing values and non-normalized entries. On both problems, I will show how to run standard machine-learning tools such as scikit-learn in the presence of such errors. The talk will be didactic and will discuss simple software solutions. It will build on the latest improvements to scikit-learn for missing values and the DirtyCat package [2] for non normalized entries. I will also summarize theoretical analyses in recent machine learning publications. 

This talk targets data practitioners. Its goal are to help data scientists to be more efficient analysing data with such errors and understanding their impacts.

With missing values, I will use simple arguments and examples to outline how to obtain asymptotically good predictions [3]. Two components are key: imputation and adding an indicator of missingness. I will explain theoretical guidelines for these, and I will show how to implement these ideas in practice, with scikit-learn as a learner, or as a preprocesser.

For non-normalized categories, I will show that using their string representations to “vectorize” them, creating vectorial representations gives a simple but powerful solution that can be plugged in standard statistical analysis tools [4].

There are many modern terminal tools with vastly improved user experiences as compared to their traditional alternatives. This talk aims to show off some of those modern terminal tools and compare them side by side with the traditional ones.

Python is not only used by software developers with fancy IDEs but also by DevOps engineers, administrators, and on remote development machines where using a GUI is impractical. Therefore, many people are stuck with a terminal interface only and have to use tools like vim, grep, find, wc, cloc, less and many others to explore their way around their Python programs.

However, thanks to the advent of many new and improved tools, we can do many of the same tasks better, faster and with nicer ergonomics.

This talk will show off effective use of vim as an IDE with completions and linting provided by LSP, fd (instead of find) for finding files, ripgrep (instead of grep) for searching strings, tokei (instead of cloc) for counting lines of code, bat (instead of cat) for looking at files, hyperfine for microbenchmarking, httpie (instead of curl) for making HTTP requests, sd (instead of sed) for text replacement.

This talk should make terminal work more approachable for all attendees by showing off how to do some everyday tasks on the terminal.

[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-10 - MongoDB  [PyData track]
[Basel, CH]

By Elizaveta Shashkova

Many Python developers like Jupyter Notebooks for their flexibility: they are very useful for interactive prototyping, scientific experiments, visualizations and many other tasks. There are different development tools which make working with Jupyter Notebooks easier and smoother, but all of them lack very important feature: visual debugger. Since Jupyter Kernel is a usual Python process, it looks reasonably to use one of existing Python debuggers with it. But is it really possible? 

In this talk we’ll try to understand how Python debugger should be changed to work with Jupyter cells and how these changes are already implemented in the PyCharm IDE. After that we’ll look into the whole Jupyter architecture and try to understand which bottlenecks in it prevent creation of universal Jupyter debugger at the moment.  

This talk requires a basic knowledge of Jupyter Notebooks and understanding of Python functions and objects. It will be interesting for people who want to learn internals of the tools they use every day. Also it might be an inspiration for people who want to implement a visual debugger in their favourite IDE.

The diversity statement quoted as follows: “The Python Software Foundation and the global Python community welcome and encourage participation by everyone. Our community is based on mutual respect, tolerance, and encouragement, and we are working to help each other live up to these principles. We want our community to be more diverse: whoever you are, and whatever your background, we welcome you.”

Diversity, big deal! As an active members and event organisers (and also on the minority side of the gender) in the Python community, we have alway been concern by the question of: Do we truly have a problem in diversity? Especially, gender diversity. We would like to find out the truth, by data science, and see if we can find a clue why and how we can fix it.

First, we will show the research others did regarding the representation of women in the R and Python communities [1]. Then, we will show the research that we did based on our experience and statistic. Including static analysis of the speakers diversity (regarding gender) at major PyCon and PyData conferences. Finally, as we all care about diversity and want improvements, we would like to find out the reason and what we can do about it. We would propose what we, the minorities and allies, could do against this seemingly unbalance situation and make the community better.

This talk is for all that who cares about diversity in our community.

[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-10 - Boston]
[Basel, CH]

By Leonardo Rochael Almeida

Object Relational Mappers (ORMs) are awesome enhancers of developer productivity. The freedom of having the library write that SQL and give you back a useful, rich model instance (or a bunch of them) instead of just a tuple or a list of records is simply amazing.

But if you forget you have an actual database behind all that convenience, then it'll bite you back, usually when you've been in production for a while, after you've accumulated enough data that your once speedy application starts slowing down do a crawl.

Databases work best when you ask them once for (or to do) a bunch of stuff, instead of asking them lots of times for small stuff.

We'll discuss how innocent looking attribute accesses on your model instances translate to sequential queries (the infamous N+1 problem).

Then we'll go through some practical solutions, taken from real cases, that resulted in massive speed ups. We'll cover how changes in Python code resulted in changes to the resulting SQL Queries.

We'll see solutions not only for queries, but also for inserts and updates, which tend to be less well documented.

Though this talk focuses on SQLAlchemy, the lessons should be applicable to most ORMs in most programing languages. The ideas discussed, and solutions proposed are also valid for any storage back-end, not only SQL databases.

This talk is geared towards Python developers with systems that talk to databases. It should be accessible to anyone who already programs in Python (early intermediary level), but will be most useful for developers with projects talking to SQL databases, specially using an ORM like SQLAlchemy. Attendees will learn to detect how N+1 query situations arise and how to work around them effectively. They will also learn how to do mass inserts and mass updates with SQLAlchemy.

By Emmanuelle Gouillart

Images are an ubiquitous form of data in various fields of science and
industry. Images often need to be transformed and processed, for example for helping medical diagnosis by extracting regions of interest or measures, or for building training sets for machine learning. 

In this talk, I will present and discuss several tools for automatic and
interactive image processing with Python. I will start by a short
introduction to scikit-image (https://scikit-image.org/), the open-source
image processing toolkit of the Pydata ecosystem, which aims at
processing images from a large class of modalities (2-D, 3-D, etc.) and
strives to have a gentle learning curve with pedagogical example-based
documentation. scikit-image provides users with a simple API based on a large number of functions, which can be used to build pipelines of image processing workflows. 

In a second part, I will explain how to use Dash for building interactive
image processing operations. Dash (https://dash.plot.ly/) is an
open-source Python web application framework developed by Plotly. Written on top of Flask, Plotly.js, and React.js, Dash is meant for building data visualization apps with highly custom user interfaces in pure Python. The dash-canvas component library of Dash (https://dash.plot.ly/canvas) is an interactive component for annotating images with several tools (freehand brush, lines, bounding boxes, ...). It also provides utility functions for using user-provided annotations for several image processing tasks such as segmentation, transformation, measures, etc. The latter functions are based on libraries such scikit-image and openCV. A gallery of examples showcases some typical uses of Dash for image processing on
https://dash-canvas.plotly.host/. Also, other components of Dash can be leveraged easily to build powerful image processing applications, such as widgets to tune parameters or data tables for inspecting object
properties.

By Marc-Andre Lemburg

Python has become the defacto standard tool for many people to write tools, command scripts, smaller applications and even large applications.

On Windows, it is fairly easy to build application bundles using e.g. py2exe, but on Unix, the situation is less obvious, unless you want to rely on OS specific Python distributions, which often require severall 100MB with of installation on the system and are usually customized in distribution specific ways.

Instead of relying on OS installed Python distributions on Unix, our open-source eGenix PyRun provides a more or less complete Python runtime (interpreter and stdlib modules) in a single file, which can be """"installed"""" by simply copying the binary to the destination system. The file can be as small as 4.8MB for Python 3.7, by using compressors such as upx.

Due to its size, it's also the perfect Python distribution for Docker containers.

The talk will show how PyRun works, is built, how to customize it to include additional modules and applications.

Geospatial data is data containing a spatial component – describing objects with a reference to the planet's surface. This data usually consists of a spatial component, of various attributes, and sometimes of a time reference (where, what, and when). Efficient processing and visualization of small to large-scale spatial data is a challenging task. 

This talk describes how to process and visualize geospatial vector and raster data using Python and the Jupyter Notebook. 

To process the data a high performance computer with 4 GPUS (NVidia Tesla V100), 192 GB RAM, 44 CPU Cores is used to run JupyterHub.

There are numerous modules available which help using geospatial data in using low- and high-level interfaces, which are shown in this presentation. In addition, it is shown how to use deep learning for raster analysis using the high performance GPUs and several deep learning frameworks.

By Samuel Colvin

I'm going to talk about the 4 main levels of parallelism in modern Computing:


multiple (virtual) machines
multiple processes
multiple threads
multiple green threads, aka asyncio


Why you might use each of them, how to go about doing so with python and some of the pitfalls you might fall into along the way.

To do so, I'll give short examples in code of achieving each level:


leveraging multiple hosts using RQ, and also the possibility of RPC with HTTP
multiprocessing and threading using their respective modules from the python standard library
asyncio demonstrated with AIOHTTP


That sounds great, but there are """"gotchas"""" you should know about before you get started, for example:


multiple machines can actually be multiple virtual machines on the same host
effectively communicating between processes is hard, how can we go about making it easier?
the limitations of threading and the GIL
runemin/emexecutor - do we ever really need to use multiprocessing or threading directly again
use of asyncio when dealing with both networking between hosts and between processes - you end up using two different kinds of concurrency at the same time. That can be confusing, but also awesome.


I'll finish of by showcasing a library I built, arq which is a job queueing and RPC library for python which uses asyncio and Redis.

One of the main Python aspects is to have a clear syntax and be an
easy-to-understand language, which compared to others like C++
(depending of the kindness of the developer) can make a huge difference.
Not only the readability is in play, having a dynamically typed
and interpreted language improves the development workflow.

This improvement comes with a cost, performance.
In most of the cases, a raw comparison of simple routines will leave
Python behind, but there is a partial solution to this problem, connecting
a powerful performant C++ library with the simplicity of Python.

In this talk, we will go through the process of generating language bindings
to allow you to take any amazing C or C++ project and bring it to Python
land. We will briefly discuss one of the many success stories, and we will
analyze how the Qt project managed to expose its whole framework to Python,
with the help of a self-made binding generator called Shiboken.

After the talk, you will be able to decide which option is better for the
projects you have in mind, and with a bit of luck you will be responsible
of exposing the next popular C++ library that makes the life of us all Pythonistas easier.

By Lilian Nandi anonymous

Our generation of young people in school (aged 5-18) have noticed the connection between Computer pRogramming, Technology &amp; Success and Billionaires.On mass they are clamoring to master the skill of Computer pRogramming. We describe a successful working model for the teaching of Computer pRogamming.

Computer Science is now regarded as one of the leading disciplines in the 21st century. Computers are ubiquitous and prevalent in most, if not all, sectors of our modern society – applications include using them in weather forecasting, robotic surgery, space exploration, e-commerce, smart cities, driverless cars, etc.

Therefore, coding or computer programming is now regarded by many as an essential skill for the young person, and it has been dubbed the ‘4th’ R’ (computer pRogramming) along with Reading, wRiting and aRithmetic.

In recognition of the new status of computer programming, governments worldwide have launched initiatives to have it taught in schools from Kindergarten through to junior school and all the way through secondary school.

So, the question emerges is how do we best teach and motivate the next generation in acquiring this skill? Given the fact that this field is very much in its infancy, there are insufficient number of skilled Computer Science teachers and very little pedagogy to guide the educator. Therefore, the whole world is learning how best to teach this subject by trial and error.

The talk will describe a case study whereby coding/computer programming, in the form of Python programming, was introduced to a group of 110 young people from the ages of 11 to 18 (Years 7-13 in a U.K secondary school). The talk will include descriptions of the various teaching methodologies introduced to the young people for this purpose and the outcomes; the talk will also address various challenges and questions about how to teach coding to young people. The talk will conclude with helpful suggestions, based on the findings of the case study, on how to proceed with the teaching of computer programming to these people.

Python's Global Interpreter Lock is a friend and rival at the same time. We, as developers, can focus on the design and implementation of applications without the hassle of memory management. On the other side, we complain about the GIL as the limiting factor of performance sensitive applications. Therefore, it is common to refactor parts of systems when the system doesn't perform or scale enough anymore. The refactoring often includes the switch of the used concurrency paradigms like replacing multithreading with multiprocessing or asyncio. Another option is moving logic of CPU-bound workload into C extensions or a full rewrite in a """"GIL-free"""" language. But how do you know that the GIL is the actual performance bottleneck?

While scaling and developing performance sensitive components in Python, my colleagues and I often also assumed the GIL as cause of our performance problems because it is a common and simple answer for this usually complex and varied problems. Instead of starting a rewrite or major refactoring, we took a step back and tried to prove our assumption. With the result that analyzing the impact of the GIL contention on the overall performance is a very interesting problem without common practices or easy usable set of tools that support Python developers.  Within this talk, I will share and explain the methods and tools, which we use to analyze the relevance of the GIL on our application performance and how it helped us to stay focused on the actual problematic areas of our applications that required improvements to meet our performance goals.

By Paolo Galeone

AutoGraph is one of the most exciting new features of Tensorflow 2.0: it allows transforming a subset of Python syntax into its portable, high-performance and language agnostic graph representation bridging the gap between Tensorflow 1.x and the 2.0 release based on eager execution.

Using AutoGraph with the code@tf.fuction/code decorator seems easy, but in practice, writing efficient and correctly graph-convertible code requires to know in detail how AutoGraph and tf.function work.

In particular, knowing how:


A graph is created and when it is re-used;
To deal with functions that create a state;
To correctly use the Tensorflow codetf.Tensor/code object instead of using the Python native types to speed-up the computation;


defines the minimum skill-set required to write correct graph-accelerable code.

The talk will guide you trough AutoGraph and codetf.function/code highlighting all the peculiarities that are worth knowing to build the right skill-set.

By Dom Weldon

Your data science or machine learning project probably won't just produce a written report. Instead, projects are increasingly expected to produce interactive tools to allow end-users to explore data and results with rich, interactive visualizations. Inevitably, this will be done in a web browser, meaning you'll need to add a quantitatively trained web developer to your team, or have your data scientists spend time learning HTML, Javascript and CSS. Dash, a project by the team that makes Plotly, solves some of these problems by allowing data scientists to build rich and interactive websites in pure python, with minimal knowledge of HTML and absolutely no Javascript. 

At decisionLab, a London-based data science consultancy producing decision tools, we've embraced Dash to produce proof-of-concept models for our projects in alpha. Although we're not officially connected to the plotly/Dash project, by using the library daily across many projects, we've learned many lessons and what we feel are best practises we'd like to share, and hear feedback on!

This talk will give an overview of Dash, how it works and what it can be used for, before outlining some of the common problems that emerge when data scientists are let loose to produce web applications, and web developers have to work with the pydata ecosystem. The talk also covers effective working practises to start producing cool interactive statistical web applications, fast. We'll also identify some of the pitfalls of Dash, and how and when to make the decision to stop using Dash and start building a proper web application.

By Petr Stehlík

At Kiwi.com we heavily rely on task queues and asynchronous execution of code to process large amounts of requests coming to our back-ends. With the separation of our codebase to microservices, we can quickly try new tools and different approaches to process these large volumes of requests. The microservice we’ll be talking about is making unreliable slow 3rd party services reliable and asynchronous with a bit of business logic sprinkled on top of it. We’ll tell a failure story of ours but resulting in a valuable lesson.

Most of our services use Celery and it’s the go-to tool for new services as well but we wanted to be different with this new microservice. RQ is the next best choice for task queues and it is presented as simpler and more straightforward than Celery. That can definitely be true but after 3 weeks of research, development and struggling we found out the unpleasant truth about being simple and making the right choices. We won’t talk about comparing the frameworks but rather about the approach on how to experiment with new things in your environment. After that, we’ll present our current setup which can take upon any number of tasks*. How we orchestrate the app and continuously integrate and deploy and what fun things await ahead of us in the development.

*Conditions may apply.

By Mustafa Anil Tuncel

Reproducibility of research is a common issue in science, especially in computationally expensive research fields e.g. cancer research.
A comprehensive picture of the genomic aberrations that occur during tumour progression and the resulting intra-tumour heterogeneity, is essential for personalised and precise cancer therapies. With the change in the tumour environment under treatment, heterogeneity allows the tumour additional ways to evolve resistance, such that intra-tumour genomic diversity is a cause of relapse and treatment failure.  Earlier bulk sequencing technologies were incapable of determining the diversity in the tumour. br /
Single-cell DNA sequencing - a recent sequencing technology - offers resolution down to the level of individual cells and is playing an increasingly important role in this field. 
We present a reproducible and scalable Python data analysis pipeline that employs a statistical model and an MCMC algorithm to infer the evolutionary history of copy number alterations of a tumour from single cells. The pipeline is built using Python, Conda environment management system and the Snakemake workflow management system. The pipeline starts from the raw sequencing files and a settings file for parameter configurations. After running the data analysis, pipeline produces report and figures to inform the treatment decision of the cancer patient.

Python is widely used to write scripts and tools, but did you know that it can also be used to build client-side end-user applications? Crossing the gap from script to app can be challenging: Join us to learn how to write modern, high quality desktop apps in Python!

At Dropbox, we’ve been fans of Python from the very beginning: we’ll take you on a tour of our app for Windows/macOS/Linux and share our “lessons learned” from over 10 years of development.

We’ll share best practices and techniques for shipping Python code to hundreds of millions of devices: discover how to maximize security, improve performance and guarantee stability.

We’ll explore the key choices we made and why: learn how we migrated to Python 3 by simultaneously shipping both versions, or how we use HTML to power our GUI (a la Electron).

We’ll reveal our favorite tools and libraries: learn how we scaled from a few engineers to over 100 and added support for other programming languages (like Rust). 

The goal of this talk is to share our learnings from using Python on Windows, macOS and Linux to encourage the use of Python when building Desktop apps.
- We also want to recognize the third-party libraries we’ve used (and their authors) to raise their profile with the overall community.
- We hope this will inspire attendees to write more desktop Python code, and raise awareness for this use case with the community as a whole. 

We intend to speak to any Python developer/engineer or enthusiast who makes use of Python in a Desktop environment (or wants to), whether it’s to make scripts, tools or apps.
We do not expect knowledge of any specific third-party Python libraries; in fact, we hope to draw attention to and recognize many libraries we’ve found useful.

Neural networks are everywhere nowadays. But while it seems everyone is using them, training your first neural network can be quite a hurdle to overcome.

In this talk I will take you by the hand, and following an example image classifier I trained, I will take you through the steps of making an image classifier in PyTorch. I will show you code snippets and explain the more intricate parts. Also, I will tell you about my experience, and about what mistakes to prevent. After this all you need to start training your first classifier is a data set!

Of course I will provide a link to the full codebase at the end. The talk will focus on the practical aspect of training a neural network, and will only touch the theoretical side very briefly. Some basic prior knowledge of neural networks is beneficial, but not required, to follow this talk.

By Tyler Brough

In this demo-driven session, we will introduce the Probo package for teaching Python programming and concepts from computational finance to beginning programmers in the domain of finance. We'll show how Python is the perfect tool for teaching computational thinking to develop deeper quantitative reasoning. Jupyter notebooks, together with Python packages such as NumPy and Pandas, provide the ideal learning environment. 

We will start by introducing the Probo package for derivative pricing and hedging. We will demo the pricing of European and American options via the famous Black-Scholes option pricing model. Other examples include Monte Carlo simulation and binomial trees. Using Probo, the answers to derivative pricing problems are right at the students' fingertips. Students can operationalize their understanding by going directly from the mathematics of derivative pricing theories to their implementation in clean and simple code.

We will end with a demonstration using Probo to teach the concept of dynamic hedging. Dynamic hedging is perhaps emthe/em crucial concept in modern financial derivatives theory. It is also one of the most difficult concepts to grasp. We'll show how developing deeper intuition is possible with computational thinking via Monte Carlo simulation of delta-hedging. By leveraging the power and simplicity of Python and Jupyter notebooks, the Probo package provides the ideal learning platform for students of computational finance.

The Python community has been warming up to static typing for a few years now. You may have seen talks that did a great job of introducing the basic concepts, mypy, and high-level strategies to cover existing code bases.

We need to go deeper.

Let’s talk about the challenges you inevitably encounter when you try to type-check a large code base. One full of many moving parts, complex architectures, metaprogramming tricks, and interfaces with a dozen other packages.

Static type checking is very powerful – when you use it to maximum advantage and explain your code to the typechecker accurately. We will cover a few tools at your disposal: generics, signature overloads, protocols, custom mypy plug-ins, and more.

There is more than just tools, though. Behind them all are universal concepts valid in any language. I hope to convince you that thinking in terms of the type system helps you write better code…

By Lilian Nandi anonymous

Our generation of young people in school (aged 5-18) have noticed the connection between Computer pRogramming, Technology &amp; Success and Billionaires.On mass they are clamoring to master the skill of Computer pRogramming. We describe a successful working model for the teaching of Computer pRogamming.

Computer Science is now regarded as one of the leading disciplines in the 21st century. Computers are ubiquitous and prevalent in most, if not all, sectors of our modern society – applications include using them in weather forecasting, robotic surgery, space exploration, e-commerce, smart cities, driverless cars, etc.

Therefore, coding or computer programming is now regarded by many as an essential skill for the young person, and it has been dubbed the ‘4th’ R’ (computer pRogramming) along with Reading, wRiting and aRithmetic.

In recognition of the new status of computer programming, governments worldwide have launched initiatives to have it taught in schools from Kindergarten through to junior school and all the way through secondary school.

So, the question emerges is how do we best teach and motivate the next generation in acquiring this skill? Given the fact that this field is very much in its infancy, there are insufficient number of skilled Computer Science teachers and very little pedagogy to guide the educator. Therefore, the whole world is learning how best to teach this subject by trial and error.

The talk will describe a case study whereby coding/computer programming, in the form of Python programming, was introduced to a group of 110 young people from the ages of 11 to 18 (Years 7-13 in a U.K secondary school). The talk will include descriptions of the various teaching methodologies introduced to the young people for this purpose and the outcomes; the talk will also address various challenges and questions about how to teach coding to young people. The talk will conclude with helpful suggestions, based on the findings of the case study, on how to proceed with the teaching of computer programming to these people.

[Basel, CH]

By Gael Varoquaux

According to industry surveys [1], the number one hassle of data scientists is cleaning the data to analyze it. Textbook statistical modeling is sufficient for noisy signals, but errors of a discrete nature break standard tools of machine learning. I will discuss how to easily run machine learning on data tables with two common dirty-data problems: missing values and non-normalized entries. On both problems, I will show how to run standard machine-learning tools such as scikit-learn in the presence of such errors. The talk will be didactic and will discuss simple software solutions. It will build on the latest improvements to scikit-learn for missing values and the DirtyCat package [2] for non normalized entries. I will also summarize theoretical analyses in recent machine learning publications. 

This talk targets data practitioners. Its goal are to help data scientists to be more efficient analysing data with such errors and understanding their impacts.

With missing values, I will use simple arguments and examples to outline how to obtain asymptotically good predictions [3]. Two components are key: imputation and adding an indicator of missingness. I will explain theoretical guidelines for these, and I will show how to implement these ideas in practice, with scikit-learn as a learner, or as a preprocesser.

For non-normalized categories, I will show that using their string representations to “vectorize” them, creating vectorial representations gives a simple but powerful solution that can be plugged in standard statistical analysis tools [4].

By Christian Barra

Infarm is a FaaS, Farming as a Service, and whether you believe it or not, our business is in-house farming at scale.

We design and build our farms, grow vegetables and sell them, and the backbone of our infrastructure is based on Python.

You can check this video to see what we do - https://twitter.com/christianbarra/status/1096399602159439874

More than 10 million observations are recorded from our farms, feeding our farm management system that allows operators, plant scientists, and supervisors to monitor each farm in real-time.

During this talk I will briefly introduce the world's problems we are trying to resolve at Infarm and then talk about our IoT farms, infrastructure, how we use Python and how we plan to improve the capabilities of our farms by adding edge machine learning.

Agenda


What are the problems we are trying to solve at Infarm
Our 4 tech pillars
How we started with Python
Issues we are facing while scaling our Python infrastructure to support &gt; 400 farms
How we plan to evolve our software and infrastructure on 4 different levels: consolidate, architecture, cloud native and observability
How Python is going to support our automated farms and its role in making the farms smarter (edge computing with AI)

By Stephan Jaensch

A main advantage of microservices is improved developer velocity. One roadblock to achieving it is giving developers the confidence that their changes are correct and safe, which is a challenging problem in such a distributed architecture. Typical approaches involve relying on automated end-to-end testing, which is costly to set up, develop tests for and run.

In this talk I will explore an approach to testing that does not require the presence of any external dependencies (not even """"fake"""" or """"test double"""" implementations of them), but provides many of the benefits of an end-to-end test. Come by to learn about how we can use a downstream service's API specification to make sure the system under test interacts with it in the correct way (""""contract testing"""") - a key ingredient missing from most unit or integration test setups. We'll then go even further to cover testing scenarios that previously could only be covered with end-to-end tests: how to maintain and validate state of your downstream dependencies.

[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-11 - Shanghai]
[Basel, CH]

By Sebastian Roll

Customer lock-in. Dubious “Land and Expand” strategies. We have all heard about outsourced software projects that run far past schedule and obliterates the budget, yet somehow fail to meet even basic requirements. 

How can this happen. How can your company reduce the risks of delegating software development to an external party? 

The Principal–Agent Problem is a well researched dilemma in economic literature. It occurs when a person or entity (“agent”), is tasked to work on behalf of another person or entity (""""principal""""). When the two parties have divergent interests, the agent might act contrary to the best interests of the principal.

Examples of principal-agent relationships are:
- Employer vs Employee
- Shareholder vs Management
- Voter vs Political party
- Contractor vs Software Consultant

When a firm decides to outsource software development to a third party, there is an economic divergence of interest at play, as both parties seek to maximize profit. The contractor wants its requirements met at low cost and on a predictable schedule. The third party, when acting nefariously, can maximize its own gains by extending the project, utilizing junior or low-cost labor, and creating a relationship of dependency.

In this session we will look into some nefarious techniques and practices used in the IT consulting industry and how best to avoid them. We will also learn why it is particularly hard to mitigate the risks of outsourced software development.

Getting started with a natural language processing and neural networks is easier nowadays thanks to the numerous talks and tutorials. The goal is to dive deeper for those who already know the basics, or want to expand their knowledge in a machine learning field. 
The talk will start with the common use cases that can be generalized to the specific problems in a NLP world. Then I will present an overview of possible features that we can use as input to our network, and show that even simple feature engineering can change our results.
Furthermore, I will compare different network architectures - starting with the fully connected networks, through convolution neural networks to recursive neural networks. I will not only considering the good parts, but also - what is usually overlooked - pitfalls of every solution. 
All of these  will be done considering number of parameters, which transfers into training and prediction costs and time. I will also share a number of “tricks” that enables getting the best results even out of the simple architectures, as these are usually the fastest and quite often hard to beat, at the same time being the easiest to interpret.

[Basel, CH]

By Florian Wahl

In this session, we will report about a forklift hailing application we built using MicroPython and the ESP32-based prototyping hardware M5Stack. 
In a production facility, machine operators can hail a forklift using an ESP32 device running MicroPython. The device sends a request to a forklift dispatcher software, written in Python. The request is queued and subsequently, the next available forklift is notified and sent to the machine. Each forklift is also fitted with an ESP32 device. In this project, the prototyping hardware M5Stack was used. It features an ESP32 micro controller with Bluetooth, WIFI, GPIO, three buttons, and a display.

Attendees will learn how MicroPython and prototyping hardware can be used to scale from an idea on the developers desk to a working system in a rough Industry 4.0 production environment. The talk will recap our journey with MicroPython, the lessons learned, and the pitfalls to avoid. Furthermore, the tooling setup will be introduced, including our M5Stack GUI-simulator to mock the M5Stack display. 

The central dispatch server is built using Python and deployed in a Docker container. Messages are exchanged using MQTT, a popular IoT message protocol. The talk will conclude with a live demonstration of the forklift hailing system. Attendees should be comfortable with the Python syntax but are not expected to have any MicroPython, MQTT, Docker or domain knowledge.

By Maria Molina-Contreras

Biology and computing are closer than we usually think, for example many algorithms are inspired in biology patterns, and complementary to that, researchers needs special algorithms to have a better understanding of our environment. Thus, there is a strong relation an dependency.
In the past years, Biology has been transformed into computational biology. Therefore
technological advances helps us to predict physical interactions between atoms and DNA, because we are being able to integrate information from biology into algorithms.

Python has become a popular programming language in biosciences because it has a clean syntax that makes it easy to read language. In addition to this, there are many modules (toolkits) extending to different biological domains, like metabolomics, structure analysis, phylogenomics, molecular biology and others. Python is currently improving researcher’s workflow, helping us to focus on the theory or experimental part, instead of fighting with old buggy applications. 

This talk aims to be oriented to all audiences (with/without biological background) since we will go together through an amazing adventure into the natural sciences using tools like Biopython, Bokeh, Networkx, Ecopy and much more! Are you brave enough to follow me on this journey?

Sarcastic talk, sharing real-life experience on both technical and social aspects of doing an architecture migration to microservices without losing a job.

Any change in software architecture is a significant time investment. Writing microservices in Python is a joy, but when you decide on it, there is often no way back. Therefore it is always an advantage to know what to expect in advance, not just from inspiring blog posts but also from the harsh reality.

I would like to share typical pitfalls of choosing a framework stack, communication protocol, conventions, and deployment process — all covered by real projects.

By Paul Hughes

This is a case study that documents how a small data science team in a big bank took on the challenge to transform a fragmented sales process into a data-driven one using Python and machine learning. 

This talk outlines the various ways Python has been instrumental in delivering a production solution that serves advisers and relationship manager on a continuous basis.

The Challenge
- A bank has many clients with diverse needs and cost pressures mean fewer advisers resulting in reduced client coverage.
- Multiple sales channels and mixed service levels meant sales processes were uncoordinated and driven by heuristics and often very subjective.
- And... Excel sheets everywhere!

Solution
- Go data-driven!
- Learn from clients and understand product usage
- Empower and inform advisers and call centre agents
- Build a front-to-back sales process (no more Excels!)
- How? With Python!

The Python Bits
- Scikit learn machine learning pipelines that implement two distinct approaches to product affinity in banking and wealth management
- SQL Alchemy based API for data engineering and rapid prototyping of analytics
- Pandas and Jupyter for development and collaboration
- Luigi pipeline for daily processing of millions of transactions and engineering features
- Extracting features from text with NLP (Spacy)
- Delivering machine learning interpretability in production, e.g. with Random Forests and treeinterpreter
- A Python module that we built with all the reusable bits: building training and prediction datasets, developing pipelines, generating monitoring data and enabling explainability

By Reuven Lerner

Decorators are one of Python's most powerful features. But even if you understand what they do, it's not always obvious what you can do with them. Sure, from a practical perspective, they let you remove repeated code from your callables. And semantically, they let you think at a higher level of abstraction, applying the same treatment to functions and classes.

But what can you actually do with them? For many Python developers I've encountered, decorators sometimes appear to be a solution looking for a problem.

In this talk, I'll show you some practical uses for decorators, and how you can use them to make your code more readable and maintainable, while also providing more semantic power. Moreover, you'll see examples of things would be hard to do without decorators. I hope that after this talk, you'll have a good sense of how to use decorators in your own Python projects.

Sound is a rich source of information about the world around us.
Modern deep learning approaches can give human-like performance on a range of sound classifiction tasks.
This makes it possible to build systems that use sound to for example:
understand speech, to analyze music, to assist in medical diagnostics, detect quality problems in manufacturing, and to study the behavior of animals.

This talk will show you how to build practical machine learning models that can classify sound.
We will convert sound into spectrograms, a visual representation of sound over time,
and apply machine learning models similar to what is used to for image classification.
The focus will be on Convolutional Neural Networks, which have been shown to work very well for this task.
The Keras and Tensorflow deep learning frameworks will be used. Some tricks for getting usable results with small amounts of data will be covered, including transfer learning, audio embeddings and data augmentation.

A basic understanding of machine learning is recommended.
Familiarity with digital sound is a bonus.

Bringing your Python scripts or apps and running them in the cloud is easier than ever with serverless computing. In this talk, we’ll show how you can use Azure Functions to easily deploy and scale your Python workloads without having to manage any servers or pay for unused compute resources. We’ll also show how deep integration with Visual Studio Code offers a great local development experience with full support for debugging and testing your app, and allows you to seamlessly deploy your serverless code to the cloud.

We’ll start by giving a brief overview of the value of serverless computing.  Next, we'll create a brand new Python app in Visual Studio Code, and start to add in business logic and ML capabilities.  Once we get the app running debugged locally, we’ll publish it to the cloud as a serverless function, and demonstrate the serverless scalability.  Finally, we’ll walk you through the tools and capabilities you can leverage around monitoring and management of your Python Azure Functions.

Did you write a cool and useful Python script? Would you like to share it with the community, but you're not sure how to go about that? If so, then this talks is for you. We'll go over a list of simple steps which can turn your script into a fully fledged open-source project.

The Python community has a rich set of tools which can help verify the quality of your code through automated code-review and linting. You can benefit by taking advantage of this ecosystem. Complete the steps in this checklist, and your project will be easier to maintain, you'll be ready to take contributions from the community and those contributions will be up to high standards. Your project will also keep up with other projects on PyPI and you will be alerted if any new release causes an incompatibility with your code.

The same checklist can be used for non open-source projects as well. 

The project maturity checklist includes:


Properly structure your code
Use a setup.py file
Add entry_points for your script command
Create a requirements.txt file
Use Black to format your code
Create a tox.ini config and include code linters
Set up a Git repo
Refactor your code to be unit-testable and add tests
Add missing docstrings
Add type annotations and a MyPy verification step
Upload to GitHub
Add a continuous integration service (e.g. Travis)
Add a requirements updater (e.g. pyup.bot)
Add test coverage checker (e.g. coveralls)
Add a Readme file and documentation
Publish your project on PyPI
Advertise your project

Observing my teams’ experimentations, the python community, and reading, I have adopted various habits, patterns, and tools. But most importantly I learned thinking in Python. I consider thinking in Python a key for rapid development and good engineering.

Thinking in a programming language affects the amount of information you need to keep in your working memory. It also affects the abstractions and tools that pop in your mind and then used in constructing solutions. 

Let’s explore what it means to think in Python. Why Python allows you to focus on problem solving, while languages like c++ often distract your attention from the problem at hand.

In this talk I will cover some good and bad practices by examples while trying to consider the amount of effort needed to write it, read it, and talk about it with other team members.

Key Takeaways: Tips for speeding your work without compromising quality, and reasoning for using it.


The audience should be comfortably familiar with the process of software development, and software problem solving, and experience using Python.

By Maria Molina-Contreras

Biology and computing are closer than we usually think, for example many algorithms are inspired in biology patterns, and complementary to that, researchers needs special algorithms to have a better understanding of our environment. Thus, there is a strong relation an dependency.
In the past years, Biology has been transformed into computational biology. Therefore
technological advances helps us to predict physical interactions between atoms and DNA, because we are being able to integrate information from biology into algorithms.

Python has become a popular programming language in biosciences because it has a clean syntax that makes it easy to read language. In addition to this, there are many modules (toolkits) extending to different biological domains, like metabolomics, structure analysis, phylogenomics, molecular biology and others. Python is currently improving researcher’s workflow, helping us to focus on the theory or experimental part, instead of fighting with old buggy applications. 

This talk aims to be oriented to all audiences (with/without biological background) since we will go together through an amazing adventure into the natural sciences using tools like Biopython, Bokeh, Networkx, Ecopy and much more! Are you brave enough to follow me on this journey?

By Daniele Procida

I present an ultra-cheap (total cost of materials :€12.50) plotter that can be built with minimal skills.

At its heart is a Raspberry Pi Zero and some relatively custom software, driving three servo motors. 

The mechanical hardware can be built from nothing but stiff card, a ball-point pen and some glue. The only tools required are a ruler, a sharp knife, a screwdriver and something to make holes in the card. 

Almost everything required can be found in a desk or kitchen drawer. The entire device can be built with no special skills in about an hour (and much of that time will be spent getting the glue off the kitchen table before you get in trouble).

As you can see from the following images, the plotter produces images with a distinct charm:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/50lemnzw5ismcrq/IMG_0075.jpg?dl=0


It can also function as the world's most inconvenient camera: take a photo using the Raspberry Pi's camera, convert it into lines, and draw it.

This is fun, but it's much more than that. There are barriers of skill, expense and materials around robotics. This project comes with me to African PyCons, and makes it possible for programmers to explore Python-based robotics, however limited their resources.

The tools and complete kit of materials to build several plotters can be carried in a small box. The plotter code is published on GitHub: https://github.com/evildmp/PantoGraph. The code for converting bitmaps to cartesian vectors is at https://github.com/evildmp/linedraw/. 

I expect this to appeal to anyone who is interested in the idea of Python-driven robotics but is put off by the cost and complexity of hardware required actually to achieve something. 

It will be particularly of interest to people involved in education, or who'd like to explore Python with young people. The code, mathematics and especially the hardware in this project are all simple. 

The code resists the temptation to abstraction, and makes a point of breaking operations down into steps that are as easy as possible to follow. The project shows that doing things with robotics isn't just for people with well-equipped workshops and the engineering skills to use them.

Sound is a rich source of information about the world around us.
Modern deep learning approaches can give human-like performance on a range of sound classifiction tasks.
This makes it possible to build systems that use sound to for example:
understand speech, to analyze music, to assist in medical diagnostics, detect quality problems in manufacturing, and to study the behavior of animals.

This talk will show you how to build practical machine learning models that can classify sound.
We will convert sound into spectrograms, a visual representation of sound over time,
and apply machine learning models similar to what is used to for image classification.
The focus will be on Convolutional Neural Networks, which have been shown to work very well for this task.
The Keras and Tensorflow deep learning frameworks will be used. Some tricks for getting usable results with small amounts of data will be covered, including transfer learning, audio embeddings and data augmentation.

A basic understanding of machine learning is recommended.
Familiarity with digital sound is a bonus.

On the last Sunday of October you may get “one more hour of sleep” but as well may spend much more time debugging code dealing with the time zones, daylight saving time shifts and datetime stuff in general.

We'll look at a few pitfalls you may encounter when working with datetimes in Python. We'll dissect the pytz library, explain why it contains over 500 individual time zones while focusing on the 63 entries in Europe. We'll also find the reason why pytz is not part of the standard Python, why it gets updated so often and why even that won't solve all your problems. Do you know what happens after 2021 when the EU stops DST switching?

Two centuries of short-sighted propaganda and long-term chaos in forty-five minutes. Maybe that will make you want to avoid time zones in your code altogether!

[Replacement talk]
This talk was a replacement for Stanislav Geidl's talk: From legacy code to modern code

Honest apologies to anyone whose expectations were subverted, but Stanislav fell sick and could not attend. Find the updated abstract below:

This talk will describe experiences and lessons learned from tackling extremely demanding code. How to bring order to mismanaged code and elevate the code base to a standard that's acceptable in today's tech environment.

Python makes wonderful code accessible at our fingertips, but it also allows us to take a lot of liberty. When you start, code is beautiful and makes sense. With each step you walk on, you find more and more hacks showing up. Eventually, the brilliant codebase you've started with can not be seen under the mud.

Not every code-base can be rewritten, not everything can be redone from scratch. Cool libraries often take a lot of liberty with code structure and make cross-integration difficult, if not impossible. Tests sound ideal, but in practice, they're just so hard to make right. Why is this, and how to change it?

The talk will tackle the problems in three parts: 
- The Easy Wins: What to do to instantly increase the code quality in your organisation. How? Why isn't it enough?
- Patterns and Antipatterns: How to identify code that """"smells"""", how to replace it? How to integrate into old code, better?
- The Philosophy: What approach to set down for the future? Why to care? How to write replace-able code. How to prevent history from repeating.

The talk will close with audience discussion and experiences, questions and proposals - building a collection of some on-premise tips and tricks.

Finally, I will go through way to deploy them on Kubernetes cluster, thus making it possible to scale Big Data pipelines on-demand and reduce infrastructure costs. I will also give tips and tricks to make Luigi Scheduler play well with Kubernetes batch execution feature.

This talk will be accompanied by demo project. It will be very beneficial for audience who have some experience in running batch jobs (not necessarily in Python), typically people who work in Big Data sphere like data scientists, data engineers, BI devs and software developers. Familiarity with Python is helpful but not needed.

[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-11 - Osaka / Samarkand [PyData track]
[Basel, CH]

By Iulia Avram

Do you remember when you used to learn algorithms? It was probably either back when you were studying for your degree, or when you were brushing up for a technical interview. If you're like most of the developers I know, solving algorithms probably went from being a fun past-time, to a bothersome necessity, to a thing of the past. Our life has been greatly improved by our tools and there's little need to know all sorting methods out there, or how to search through a tree. Or maybe we're wrong, maybe knowing these things could make a difference in how we write code. 

I am going to try to dispel some of the myths surrounding the study of algorithms and competitive programming, and argue that sharpening this skill is something that benefits us, as software developers, outside of passing technical tests; that knowing many algorithms makes us better and faster problem solvers.

Lastly, this talk is about resources and ways in which to gamify the study of algorithms. Going at it the same way as for exams or interviews makes it very bothersome very quickly. It gets easy to lose sight of the biggest picture and to start thinking of algorithms in abstract terms, outside their applications. All these are factors that prompt the question: why should I carry on with it?

Therefore, something needs to be changed in the way we do this. Algorithms are fun and they don't deserve the disdain we give them. Knowing algorithms is not only for the geniuses and innovators.

By Ronan Lamy

PyPy is a fast and compliant implementation of Python. In other words, it's an interpreter for the Python language that can act as a full replacement for the reference interpreter, CPython. It's optimised to enable efficient just-in-time (JIT) compilation of Python code to machine code, and has releases matching versions 2.7, and 3.6. It now also supports the main pillars of the scientific ecosystem (numpy, Cython, scipy, pandas, ...) thanks to its emulation layer for the C API of CPython.

The PyPy JIT is often just described as """"magically running your code faster"""", but is actually what is known as a """"meta-tracing JIT"""". 
A tracing JIT optimises loops by recording and optimising a single, hopefully representative, execution of the loop. While crude, that approach is known to be effective for just-in-time compiler. Additionally, PyPy's JIT is """"meta"""" in the sense that it traces the execution of the interpreter while it runs some user-code instead of tracing the user-code directly. This again simplifies the compiler. We will explore how all this works together and is implemented (spoiler: it's Python all the way down!).

This talk assumes no prior knowledge of compiler theory nor of PyPy internals, and should be of interest to anybody who wishes that their pure-Python code would run faster. The audience will gain a firmer understanding of how PyPy operates and optimises code, and how to how to get the most out of the PyPy JIT.

Are you bored by 3D-plots that only give you a simple rotatable 2d-projection? plotVR is an open source package that provides a simple way for data scientists to plot data, pick up a phone, get a real 3d impression - either by VR or by AR - and use the computer's keyboard to walk through the scatter plot:

precodehttps://www.github.com/thomann/plotVR
/code/pre

After installing and plotting your dataframe open your phone's browser and use your GoogleVR Cardboard. Furthermore performant Android- and iOS-apps are available - both support VR-Cardboard and the iOS-Version also AR.

Once you are immersed in your Cardboard how do you navigate through the scatter? plotVR lets you use the computer's keyboard to walk as you would in any first person game.

You want to share your impression? Just save the HTML and publish it.

The technologies beneath this project are: a web server that handles the communication between the DataScience-session and the phone, WebSockets to quickly proxy the keyboard events, QR-codes facilitate the simple pairing of both, and an HTML-Page on the computer to grab the keyboard events. And the translation of these keyboard events into 3D terms is a nice exercise in three.js, OpenGL, and SceneKit for HTML, Android, and iOS resp.

By Mario Corchero

Did you know there are multiple ways to raise and capture exceptions? Have you ever wondered if you should raise a built-in exception or create your own hierarchy? Did you ever find it hard to understand what an exception meant?
This talk will go through the decisions needed to raise and capture exceptions when creating a library. We will look at how to translate and handle errors, create your own exceptions, and make exceptions clear and easy to troubleshoot, while also understanding how they actually work, common pitfalls.

This talk will enable intermediate developers to leave the room with a solid understanding of how to work effectively with exceptions. As the exception flow usually goes untested, this will help prevent frustrating situations when errors occur that are not easy to understand or when an unexpected result is produced. The talk will delve into the different ways of working with exceptions. We will illustrate this with a real-world example to which many developers will be able to relate.

Following the talk, intermediate developers will leave the room more informed and better prepared to create and handle exceptions, having learned about many utilities that were already available to them, but were never used or were used improperly.

The not-so-advanced Pythonistas will get an in-depth dive into exceptions. Even if they might not be able to grasp all of the content, they will get a sense of the features that most programmers are unaware of and learn to use them when the proper situation arrives.

Advanced programmers will find this to be a humorous talk that will certainly teach them at least one new thing, as I will dive into parts of the grammar of Python that even many advanced programmers are not used to.

The talk is also full of niche information like why the variable that catches exceptions doesn’t like outside of the codeexcept/code scope.
The talk is comprised of four main sections preceded by an introduction to the problem and a conclusion with time for questions at the end. We will look at how to raise, capture, create and design exceptions, offering tips and pitfalls in each section.

Do you have numerical code written in Python and Numpy? Do you wish it ran faster, using the full potential of your CPU?

Then you should try Numba, a JIT compiler that translates a subset of Python and Numpy code into fast machine code.

This talk will explain how Numba works, and when and how to use it for numerical algorithms, focusing on how to get very good performance on the CPU.

To understand this talk, only a basic knowledge of Python and Numpy is needed.

You will learn how Python compiles functions to bytecode and how Numba compiles bytecode to machine code. Why algorithms implemented using Numpy sometimes don't yield great performance, and how to do better using Numba. You will learn about the @numba.jit and @numba.vectorize decorators and how to create functions that use the CPU well by using e.g. multi-threading (several CPU cores), vector instructions (single instruction multiple data) and fast math (trade float accuracy for speed).

You will also learn when it does and doesn't make sense to use Numba, by contrasting it briefly with some other options for high-performance computing from Python: PyPy, C, C++, Cython, Numexpr, Dask, PyTorch, Tensorflow and Google JAX

[Basel, CH]

By Christian Heimes

Python has built-in tracing and profiling facilities in form of callback hooks in the sys module. The settrace and setprofile callbacks have several drawbacks. They slow down the Python interpreter considerable and only allow tracing of Python code. Modern OS and CPUs come with a variety of APIs for efficient and low-level tracing down to system calls, Kernel space code, and hardware events. Some tools even create code that runs in Kernel space.

This talks is an introduction and comparison of various low and high level tools for profiling and tracing as well as visualization tools like flame graphs. It covers ptrace, perf, SystemTap, and BCC/eBPF. Ptrace based commands like strace are easy to use but slow. Perf allows lightweight profiling of hardware events and CPU instructions. SystemTap is a powerful toolkit plus DSL to instrument probe points inside the Kernel as well as static SystemTap/DTrace markers in libs and languages like Java, PHP, and Python. CPython comes with a set of instrumentations for SystemTap. BCC is a collection of tools that run as JIT optimized eBPF code in Kernel space.

The talk is an introduction to basic concepts of low-level tracing and profiling on Linux. The main goal is the show the potential of the tools.

By Michele Simionato

This is a talk for people who need to perform large numeric calculations. They could be scientists, developers working in close contact with scientists, or even people working on finance and other quantitative fields. Such people are routinely confronted with issues like

1 parallelism: how to parallelize calculations efficiently
2 data: how to store and manage large amounts of data efficiently
3 memory: how to avoid running out of memory
4 performance: how to be fast

The goal of the talk is to teach some lessons learned after several years of doing numeric simulations in a context were micro-optimizations are the least important factor, while overall architecture, design choices and good algorithms are of paramount importance.

Processing lots of data, in need of more speed, or struggling to make use of native code? The Cython compiler for Python solves all of these problems in a pythonic way, by compiling Python code to optimised C code.

Cython [1] has a very long history of faithfully helping users to solve their Python performance problems  and integrating native code into Python in production critical settings, while stimulating somewhat less confidence with its 0.x versioning scheme. For the next Cython version, a stable 3.0 release, we are planning to clean up several historically grown issues in the language to make the Cython compiler more friendly for modern Python users to work with.

In this talk, I will show how Cython can be used for compiling and speeding up Python code, using fast native data structures and libraries. I will then give an overview of the changes that are on their way for the 3.0 release and how they will affect the user experience.

Over the past couple of years, there has been increasing interest in applying the latest advances in machine learning to creative projects in art and design. From DeepDream and style transfer to a GAN-generated painting selling for $430,000 at auction, AI art has moved beyond the world of research and academia and become a trend in its own right. Meanwhile, the contemporary art world's fascination with the social impact of facial recognition, recommendation systems and deep fakes has encouraged artists to explore AI critically as subject matter. This talk will give an overview of how artists and technologists are using and thinking about machine learning, its creative potential and societal impact.

[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-11 - Boston]
[Basel, CH]

By Daniele Procida

I present an ultra-cheap (total cost of materials :€12.50) plotter that can be built with minimal skills.

At its heart is a Raspberry Pi Zero and some relatively custom software, driving three servo motors. 

The mechanical hardware can be built from nothing but stiff card, a ball-point pen and some glue. The only tools required are a ruler, a sharp knife, a screwdriver and something to make holes in the card. 

Almost everything required can be found in a desk or kitchen drawer. The entire device can be built with no special skills in about an hour (and much of that time will be spent getting the glue off the kitchen table before you get in trouble).

As you can see from the following images, the plotter produces images with a distinct charm:


https://www.dropbox.com/s/s7x3cnxzp1zwnp0/europython.jpg?dl=0

https://www.dropbox.com/s/50lemnzw5ismcrq/IMG_0075.jpg?dl=0


It can also function as the world's most inconvenient camera: take a photo using the Raspberry Pi's camera, convert it into lines, and draw it.

This is fun, but it's much more than that. There are barriers of skill, expense and materials around robotics. This project comes with me to African PyCons, and makes it possible for programmers to explore Python-based robotics, however limited their resources.

The tools and complete kit of materials to build several plotters can be carried in a small box. The plotter code is published on GitHub: https://github.com/evildmp/PantoGraph. The code for converting bitmaps to cartesian vectors is at https://github.com/evildmp/linedraw/. 

I expect this to appeal to anyone who is interested in the idea of Python-driven robotics but is put off by the cost and complexity of hardware required actually to achieve something. 

It will be particularly of interest to people involved in education, or who'd like to explore Python with young people. The code, mathematics and especially the hardware in this project are all simple. 

The code resists the temptation to abstraction, and makes a point of breaking operations down into steps that are as easy as possible to follow. The project shows that doing things with robotics isn't just for people with well-equipped workshops and the engineering skills to use them.

[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-12 - PyCharm]
[Basel, CH]

By Juan Santos

Reading standards documents can be a dull task. But like in other fields, standards in Python play a big part. Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) are defined, improved, and eventually implemented by the community. They apply to mostly anything related to Python, from the more abstract and general to the more concrete and specific. Paying attention to them, and knowing which ones to read beforehand is a vital task that should take place prior to writing the first lines of code in a project.

In this talk we will go over a condensed list of the most important PEPs to this date and see how they influence everyday coding. From style guides and docstring conventions to data classes and assignment expressions, we will see how these PEPs affect (or can affect) the code we write, and how can we use them to improve our code and make developing easier and more fun.

After this talk, attendees will have a better grasp on why PEPs are important to Python, which are a must read, and which ones they should use as a guide in the future, both for coding and refactoring.

In this talk I reframe a computer programming workshop for kids I delivered earlier this year, exploring and sharing my experience throughout that journey, from preparation to delivery, by recreating a simple yet engaging enough game.

With that I'll both demonstrate several Python related techniques and tools many may not be aware of, on one hand, and, on the other, extract provocative questions about general learning processes, especially when targeted at professional developers.

I promise zero slides and a somewhat fast-paced live (re)coding session, intertwined with comments on good/bad techniques, along with a surprising exploration of the turtle module in the Standard Library -- it is more capable than you think.

I wrap up with a self-code review and with thoughts on how such a game could be improved, what implications that could have for both beginners and seasoned professionals: should you do this at work?

Targeting 10 minute Q&amp;A / discussion by the end!

[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-12 - Shanghai]
[Basel, CH]

By James Saryerwinnie

You've been given a task.  You need to download some files from a server to your local machine.   The files are fairly small, and you can list and access these files from the remote server through a REST API.  You'd like to download them as fast as possible.  The catch?  There's a billion of them.  Yes, one billion files.

How would would you do this?  Would you do this synchronously in a single for loop?  Would you use a producer/consumer queue with threads?  Multiprocessing?  Asyncio?

In this talk, we'll examine 3 different mechanisms for concurrently downloading files: multithreading, multiprocessing, and asyncio.

For each of these mechanisms we'll look at design best practices, how to handle debugging and error handling, and of course the overall performance.  By examining three different approaches using the same data set, we gain a better understanding of the tradeoffs of each approach so we can pick the right library for the job.

Four years ago I talked about code quality during EuroPython in Bilbao. A lot of things changed from that time. Firstly, most tools I presented were still developed and gained new features, but also new ones appeared I wanted to discuss with you. Secondly, Python changed, Python 3 has type hints on board and there is a new tool dedicated to checking the types. Thirdly - I changed. I'm more distanced form my zealous approach from four years ago. I got real and reasonable. That's why I wanted to talk about code quality tools in Python again.
I'll talk about all the software that can make code review a bit simpler by pointing out possible errors, duplicates or unused code. I'll talk again about formatters and how can they be used in modern-time projects. And I'll talk about hobgoblins, if you know what I mean :)

This talk tells the story of Mu, a native code editor written in Python (https://codewith.mu/).

One Sunday afternoon I foolishly asked myself, """"How hard can it be to write a simple code editor?"""" Several years later an international team of volunteers are still working on the project. We have had to address:


Cross platform GUI development.
Cross platform packaging solutions for Python.
Creating an interactive visual debugger.
Integrating with iPython notebook.
Integrating with various IoT MicroPython devices.
Integrating with frameworks such as PyGame/PyGameZero and Flask.
Automating cross platform testing.
Researching and testing UX with a challenging user base.
Accessibility for all.
Internationalisation.
Creating an inclusive, welcoming and supportive community.


This talk will explain why Mu was created, how Mu was created and, most importantly, shares the decision making, technical research and implementation details of Mu in the hope others can learn from our mistakes, mis-steps and muck-ups.

[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-12 - Singapore]

By Peter Sperl

Two years ago, we began migrating from a proprietary service framework to a WSGI-compliant one. We chose uWSGI as our host because of its performance and feature set. But, while powerful, uWSGI's defaults are driven by backward compatibility and are not ideal for new deployments. Powerful features can be overlooked due to the sheer magnitude of its feature set and spotty documentation. As we've scaled up the number of services hosted by uWSGI over the last year, we've had to tweak our standard configuration.

In this talk, we'll present the base uWSGI configuration we use as a starting point for all services, as well as some tips to avoid known gotchas and provide a base level of defensiveness and high reliability. This base configuration makes use of several """"no-cost"""" uWSGI features that help protect services from common, yet difficult to prevent issues -- some of which we discovered the hard way. We'll also talk about some programmatic uWSGI features which can be leveraged to improve reliability and improve outage response.

Some of the topics we'll cover include:
- Mitigating memory leaks
- Mitigating stuck, hung, or infinitely looping processes
- Preventing misconfigurations
- Preventing wasted development effort
- Improving outage response

Angklung is a traditional musical instrument from Indonesia. This instrument has a lot of variety in how it is performed; a common format is the orchestral format in which 15-30 players gather to form a team. Playing Angklung in this way is fun but also presents some challenges that are hard to solve manually.

First, I will introduce you to the instrument and how it works/how it is played. Then, I will show you how Python-based algorithms can be used to ease the pains of managing Angklung teams, by reading Angklung-specific sheet music and calculating the most optimal distribution of Angklung based on several important factors.

By Danny Engelbarts

The goal of this talk is to show the audience a different way of thinking about and developing regex statements. 

I have been working with UNIX for decades now and, although i always managed to avoid Perl, i have been intrigued with Regex constructs ever since my first encounter. These weird unreadable things that can transform text like nothing else or can find what i’m looking for in massive files, in no time at all. I’ve created regexes that only appeal to the most nerdiest of nerds and i’ve stunned colleagues by fixing their futile regex attempts in just a few keystrokes. But when Damian Conway showed me how regexes really work i was awestruck. And now i want to share this knowledge.

This talk is aimed at pythonistas that have some experience with the re module. I will take some easy examples and explain in plain english how a regex engine searches for a match. This will show that a regex is not some mysterious incomprehensible pattern description or declarative blueprint. Instead it is a small program that is very good at comparing single characters. Like any programming language it turns out that once you understand the rules and structure it suddenly becomes so much easier to use. 

With this new found knowledge we will up the ante and try some more difficult stuff, adding other semantics and some tips and tricks. We’ll look at some pitfalls, maybe compare regex to python solutions and have a look at some regexes found in the wild (either on my drive or on github).

In this talk I'm going to live code a web application that is built exclusively on top of WebSocket, without using HTTP at all!

What's the benefit of using WebSocket over HTTP, you may ask? With WebSocket each client establishes a permanent connection to the server, so there is no request/response cycle and no need for the client to poll the server for data. Each side can freely send data to the other side at any time, so this is an ideal stack for building highly dynamic, event-driven applications.

For this live coding exercise I'm going to use the Socket.IO server for Python, and the Socket.IO client for JavaScript. No Flask, no Django, no HTTP!

I will share code and command examples explaining how we are operating our applications since our recent transition from REST APIs on Web servers to GraphQL APIs containers on Kubernetes. 

This talk will not be about the difference between REST and GraphQL but focus on the workflow, tools and experience we gained in switching our run time environments and API models.

At Numberly, we have built and are operating our own on-premise Kubernetes cluster so we will also be talking about its capabilities and share some of the experience we gained in doing so.

- How we designed our Kubernetes cluster, its capabilities and the choices we made
- Developer workflow, environments management and deployment
- Our GraphQL stack, featuring a sample application
- What we're still working on to improve

[Basel, CH]

By Mikhail Bushkov, Max Vogler

GRR Rapid Response (https://github.com/google/grr) is an incident response framework focused on remote live forensics.

It consists of a Python client (agent) that is installed on target systems, and Python server infrastructure that can manage and talk to clients. The goal of GRR is to support forensics and investigations in a fast, scalable manner to allow analysts to quickly triage attacks and perform analysis remotely.

GRR was started at Google in 2009 as a simple Python helper script used by Incident Response engineers. Eventually a little Python script got a little server component, was adapted to run on multiple systems (Mac, Linux, Windows), then a little UI was added and a few nice features were introduced (large-scale hunts, collection of predefined artifacts, memory analysis). A helper script has eventually evolved into a sophisticated framework with 180,000 lines of Python code.

In the presentation we’ll talk about the process of evolving a small prototype-like Python project into a production-ready system, using GRR as an example. The topics that we’ll cover are:
* Taking shortcuts - both in terms of design and implementation. Reasons for taking them and their eventual costs.
* Relying on Python’s power features (i.e. meta-classes, mixins)? Long-term consequences on maintainability and readability. 
* Organising the project into separate PyPI packages - benefits of doing that.
* Continuous integration, testing and automated builds for various platforms - implementation costs and maintainability effects.

Nowadays everyone wants to bring Agile Best Practices into all the teams, but it's a hard task to implement it and adapt based on different teams. Setting up all necessary Agile meetings and using buzz words is not enough for the team to be happy and successful while working in Agile environment.
Inspired by the """"Divine Comedy"""" by Dante Alighieri, I decided to create a short guide into Agile best practices. It will guide through Failures, Challenges to the Success in building a happy dream team!
This talk is divided into three parts:
1. Failures in setting up Agile processes for a team.
2. Challenges on the way to happy and successful team.
3. Successful examples how to have happy and productive Agile team and constantly deliver a great product.

By Bernat Gabor

Python is easy to learn and use programming language; however, managing dependencies and package versions for it are nowhere as pleasant. One of the basic building block created to help with this is virtual environments. Join me in understanding how virtual environments work from within (by one of the project maintainers); also, to find out if the good old virtualenv project has any place left, now that Python 3.4+ contains venv.

This talk is aimed to be a bit more technical in its first parts, presenting in technical details what a virtualenv is. The target audience is anyone who used virtual environments and wants to understand how they tick from within. I’ll also emphasise diversity and inclusion at Python interpreter level by highlighting other interpreters than CPython: Jython, PyPy or Iron Python. A concise outline goes as follows:

What is a virtual environment?
- why we need it
- what we use it for
- demo - virtualenv vs system env
How do we build a virtual environment (CPython)
- technical workflow of venv creation
- activation
-- bash
-- powershell
-- cmd.bat
Other interpreters
- why other than CPython?
- PyPy
- Jython
- virtualenv
- all Python support
- extra activation - xonosh

[Basel, CH]

By Łukasz Kąkol

Code review is not just boring duty. It's mutual responsibility for the software we're releasing. It's one of the most critical aspects of code quality, and therefore it's the first step of quality assurance. This is also the key to easier programming and better maintainability. Clean code is much easier to debug, and it's much harder to introduce a bug in such code.
When you think about code review, you probably think about verifying and examining the code. Reviewing the expert's code may look like a waste of time because he knows what he's doing. Reviewing the code by a beginner may look like a waste of time because he's not able to find as many defects as an experienced developer. Code review is a code quality tool in the first place, but it's also much beyond that. You can teach or help someone, learn from somebody and much more both from the position of reviewer and reviewee.
There is much more about the real power of code review which I want to share with you.
This talk is also about how to do it the right way and how to not do it based on lessons learned and my experience within the diverse teams of people with a variety of knowledge and experience. I was reviewing the code but, on the other hand, I was also being reviewed. I'd like to pass my observations to people who are reviewing the code both in commercial and open source projects for a while. This talk is also for those who want to start to review the code, but they do not know how to do it.

By Max Humber

When you learn a new language, like French or German or even English, you first learn how to read. Then you learn how to write. When you learn a new emprogramming/em language, you first learn how to write. And that’s it. 

Imagine that you were never formally taught how to read. And that you were told that you should just figure it out … by writing … a whole bunch. How would that even work? I don’t think it would.

If you can’t read. You can’t write. It’s that simple. 

Do you think that Shakespeare would be Shakespeare if he never read a single book in his entire life? No. Nothing is created in a vacuum. Good writers are good writers because they’re good readers. 

Just as reading is an invaluable skill so to is reading code. It’s a skill that’s never formally taught. But it’s a skill that is essential nonetheless. In this talk I’ll show you how to effectively read code so that might write better code.

By Radoslav Georgiev

Software development is a team game.

When we want to deliver more work, one of the variables that we can change is the team size. But as we all know, increasing the team size does not automatically translate into increased productivity &amp; more features shipped.

If things are left unmanaged, people can step on each other toes, block each other &amp; generally decrease the overall productivity of a given software project.

In this talk we'll identify different problems teams can face &amp; see how we can solve them using different strategies &amp; patterns.

In the end, we want to enable the team to perform better &amp; ship features with high confidence. We want enable the team &amp; put its potential into building good software.

Problems we are going to cover:


Constant merge conflicts / working in the same files
Blocking each other on different features / Feature deadlock
Constantly switching between bugfixing &amp; feature development
Constant regressions and things breaking down
Fighting with local setup &amp; not being able to properly test things, especially when working with 3rd parties
Merge strategies &amp; improving the work with git &amp; GitHub
Communication between team members &amp; ego fights


For each problem, we are going to propose different solutions with provided real-life examples from our experience &amp; projects.

The examples show are going to be in the context of large Python / Django projects.

This talk is the natural sequel of the following talks from previous EuroPythons:

By building a simplified chaos monkey service, we will walk through how to create a good foundation for an asyncio-based service, including graceful shutdowns, proper exception handling, and testing asynchronous code. We’ll get into the hairier topics as well, covering topics like working with synchronous code, debugging and profiling, and working with threaded code. We’ll learn how to approach asynchronous and concurrent programming with Python’s asyncio library, take away some best practices, and learn what pitfalls to avoid.

Outline:
(40 minutes + 5 min Q&amp;A, if unable to get 45 minutes, then 30 min slot with no time for Q&amp;A)

Initial setup of an asyncio service (2m)
--- Required boilerplate code
--- Inspiration from official asyncio tutorial docs
Making a service emactually/em concurrent (5m)
--- non-blocking vs concurrent
--- when to be concurrent vs serial 
--- using callbacks vs awaits vs scheduling tasks (create_task) vs asyncio.Events
--- Making synchronous code asyncio-friendly (2m)
Intermediate (9m - trimmed to 6m for 30 min slot)
Graceful shutdowns (3m)
--- What a signal handler is, why it’s needed
--- What signals to listen to
--- Gotchas of cancelling tasks, asyncio.shield + shutdown behavior
Exception handling (3m)
--- Difference between top-level exception handling and handling within other coroutines
--- Avoid mistakenly swallowing/missing raised exceptions
--- Making use of loop.setemexception/emhandler
Making threaded code asyncio-“friendly” (3m)

By Holger Krekel

Delta Chat, a new approach to decentralized messaging, uses Python in several ways. Delta Chat is a Whatsapp/Telegram-style messenger app  which uses the existing e-mail server network instead of central servers. There is no address book upload, and no necessity to tie accounts to mobile numbers. We'll live-demo how """"Chat over E-mail"""" works, with random audience members, in real-time. 

We'll then look into how Python is used for automated testing (with pytest) against the messenger core library which is exposed through CFFI. However, the core library will soon be ported to full Rust. Are there better ways to interface Rust with Python than going through C-interfaces?

In the third part we'll introduce first example Chat Bots, written in Python. Do you want to send an machine-generated system allert to a sysadmin group? Or safely archive all media that is posted to a family group?  Or have your IoT sensor react to commands or send info?  Just do it without registering a bot to some central cite, or by exposing all content information to (e. g. Telegram) servers. A Chat Bot only needs access to a standard IMAP/SMTP account. We'll look at the simple Python API for writing and testing powerful and versatile Chat bots.

[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-12 - Singapore]

By Peter Sperl

Two years ago, we began migrating from a proprietary service framework to a WSGI-compliant one. We chose uWSGI as our host because of its performance and feature set. But, while powerful, uWSGI's defaults are driven by backward compatibility and are not ideal for new deployments. Powerful features can be overlooked due to the sheer magnitude of its feature set and spotty documentation. As we've scaled up the number of services hosted by uWSGI over the last year, we've had to tweak our standard configuration.

In this talk, we'll present the base uWSGI configuration we use as a starting point for all services, as well as some tips to avoid known gotchas and provide a base level of defensiveness and high reliability. This base configuration makes use of several """"no-cost"""" uWSGI features that help protect services from common, yet difficult to prevent issues -- some of which we discovered the hard way. We'll also talk about some programmatic uWSGI features which can be leveraged to improve reliability and improve outage response.

Some of the topics we'll cover include:
- Mitigating memory leaks
- Mitigating stuck, hung, or infinitely looping processes
- Preventing misconfigurations
- Preventing wasted development effort
- Improving outage response

Making computer games is difficult: it requires creativity, multidisciplinary knowledge of art, psychology, math, computer science, physics and others, patience, open mind and dedication. Making computer games with Python is a nightmare. You hit practically every sharp corner that Python has, starting with installation, through binary libraries, poor hardware support, up to distribution.

PewPew devices are an attempt at solving the worst problems by giving you a dedicated, cheap, simple and portable gaming device, that you can easily program with Python with just a simple text editor. They also make pretty neat conference badges. I will talk about how they were conceived, how they are used, and how you can extend and improve them yourself.

At the end of the talk you should have a good idea about what is CircuitPython and MicroPython and how they can be used to build and program such simple devices. You should also know where to find the resources necessary to try designing and building your own.

The goal of this talk is to show the audience a different way of thinking about and developing regex statements. 

I have been working with UNIX for decades now and, although i always managed to avoid Perl, i have been intrigued with Regex constructs ever since my first encounter. These weird unreadable things that can transform text like nothing else or can find what i’m looking for in massive files, in no time at all. I’ve created regexes that only appeal to the most nerdiest of nerds and i’ve stunned colleagues by fixing their futile regex attempts in just a few keystrokes. But when Damian Conway showed me how regexes really work i was awestruck. And now i want to share this knowledge.

This talk is aimed at pythonistas that have some experience with the re module. I will take some easy examples and explain in plain english how a regex engine searches for a match. This will show that a regex is not some mysterious incomprehensible pattern description or declarative blueprint. Instead it is a small program that is very good at comparing single characters. Like any programming language it turns out that once you understand the rules and structure it suddenly becomes so much easier to use. 

With this new found knowledge we will up the ante and try some more difficult stuff, adding other semantics and some tips and tricks. We’ll look at some pitfalls, maybe compare regex to python solutions and have a look at some regexes found in the wild (either on my drive or on github).

Ensuring reliably repeatable dependency installation has long been an unsolved problem for many Python projects. Pinning dependencies via setup.py and requirements.txt has historically been met with extra work and unexpected results, particularly when managing the dependencies of dependencies.

Thanks to PEP 518, Python projects can now more easily manage dependencies via the new pyproject.toml file specification. In its wake, a number of useful tools have arisen that use this file to provide enhanced dependency resolution, including Poetry, Hatch, and Pipenv.

Attendees of this talk will take home the following knowledge and skills:


how to replace three files (setup.py, requirements.txt, and MANIFEST.ini) with just one: pyproject.toml
why dependency resolution is hard and why it matters
how Poetry, Hatch, and Pipenv differ and when to use each
why one might use a less magical alternative: pip-tools
how to use pipx to isolate system-wide Python tools

Next year Python 2 is no longer maintained. But you have a monster code base with clever tricks and libraries that don't support Python 2, and your data may be stored in a format that is hard to move Python 3. And that's the easy bit.

This talk focuses on the process of moving, not the code changes. Because it's the process that is the hard part. How do you get your code in a state where it's ready to move? How do you get the whole team on the boat to Python 3?

All Python 3 talks I have seen, including those I have given, and all the texts on how to port, including the book I wrote, focus on the code changes. With increasing backwards compatibility in Python 3 and forward-compatibility in Python 2, this actually became a lesser problem for big code bases.

In this talk I would like to share the workflow and tools we use to build, deploy and operate GraphQL APIs on our on-premise Kubernetes cluster.

I will share code and command examples explaining how we are operating our applications since our recent transition from REST APIs on Web servers to GraphQL APIs containers on Kubernetes. 

This talk will not be about the difference between REST and GraphQL but focus on the workflow, tools and experience we gained in switching our run time environments and API models.

At Numberly, we have built and are operating our own on-premise Kubernetes cluster so we will also be talking about its capabilities and share some of the experience we gained in doing so.

Proposed agenda:
- Our previous workflow and its limitations
- How we designed our Kubernetes cluster, its capabilities and the choices we made
- Developer workflow, environments management and deployment
- Our GraphQL stack, featuring a sample application
- What we're still working on to improve

What you do when you start a new project? Usually, we begin with database design, then we prepare a migration system, user registration, and all different stuff that distracts us from doing what is most important - business logic. With the clean architecture, we can learn how to start a project in another way and this will be one of two main topics of my talk. The second one will be about new features in Python. You probably heard about typings, mypy, and dataclasses, but I will show you how they can be used in real life project that can be developed over many years in production lifecycle. There will be no """"hello world"""" app, no copy &amp; paste of documentation, only practical knowledge learned through many years of practice.

By Alessandro Molina

The Python Standard Library is a very rich toolset, which is the reason why Python is stated to come with """"batteries included"""". In such an amount of features and tools it's easy to get lost and miss some of the less unknown modules or gems hidden within the whole load of functions and classes.

This talk aims at showcasing some recipes, snippets and usages of standard library modules and functions that are less known or that are not covered in the most common books and tutorials available for Python.

The talk will try to showcase a bunch of short examples in the hope to foster the """"oh, wow! I didn't think about that"""" reaction at least once in the audience.
We will see how frequently for tasks where you used third party libraries or frameworks a solution bultin into the standard library is already available, and such solution is guaranteed to be maintained and well working for the years to come thanks to the standard library reliability and stability.

The showcased examples are took from the “Modern Python Standard Library Cookbook” book that I authored.

Deployment automation, cloud platforms, containerization, short iterations to develop and release software—we’ve progressed a lot. And finally it’s official: Kubernetes and OpenShift are the established platforms to help us do scaling and zero downtime deployments with just a few hundred lines of YAML. It’s a great time.

Can we finally put all our eggs into one basket? Identify the cloud platform that fits our needs, and jump on it? That could well backfire: Vendor lock-in is the new waterfall, it slows you down. In future you’ll want to jump over to the next better platform, in a matter of minutes. Not months.

This talk is about The Art of Writing deployment pipelines that will survive Kubernetes, OpenShift and the like. It’s for Python developers and Kubernetes enthusiasts of all levels – no domain specific knowledge required, all you need to understand will be explained. You’ll learn how to separate application-specific and deployment-specific configuration details, to maximize your freedom and avoid vendor lock-in.

Come see a demo of a Django project setup that covers everything from local development to automatic scaling, flexible enough to be deployed on any of your favorite container platforms. Take home a working, future-proof setup for your Python applications.

- had to to create a separate project and had the issue of interfacing both?
- had to handle disconnections?
- had to handle reconnections?
- had to handle all the above and scale WebSockets?

The following arguments will be discussed: 
- intro to the subject
- inner workings
- differences from WebSockets
- implementation explanation for a generic HTTP server in Python
- use cases

[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-12 - Osaka / Samarkand]
[Basel, CH]

By Wojciech Rząsa

HTTP or asynchronous communication in microservices? This question is frequently repeated and discussed. Obviously, HTTP-based communication is easier for developers and architects. Even if your developers have no prior experience with microservices, they will probably understand how to implement an HTTP service well. While asynchronous communication has a lot of advantages that allow to design and implement really robust microservices system, they also bring new challenges not so obvious for people who didn’t have a chance to work with such an environment before.

In FLYR we mostly have HTTP-based Inter Process Communication (IPC)  in our infrastructure. At some point, we realized that to provide the functionality required by our product we needed something more flexible and more… asynchronous. We designed and implemented a Python library to facilitate switching to asynchronous IPC, supporting one- or two-way or even single-request – multi-response communication. An important thing in the design process was to provide developers having HTTP experience a tool that would ease the process of switching to asynchronous communication. Consequently, to switch an HTTP server-side endpoint to asynchronous IPC is a straightforward task.

We selected Kafka for our message broker, not surprisingly by comparing its performance reports with our very rough, but no less demanding performance requirements. But we also took care to hide the details of the broker logic from developers. Yes, we don’t use all Kafka capabilities, if you need e.g. Kafka Streams, you will have to use another solution. But we can decide what capabilities are used in our microservices and how we can make changes in the way our services communicate in a single place. There are also hooks, Kubernetes health checks and more with a lot of flexibility available out of the box.

We plan to opensource our library. At the moment of writing it ‘opensourcing’ is still a work in progress and we didn’t have sufficient time to do it due to strict time constraints we have on delivering functionality to our customers, but we hope to be able to do it soon. In this talk I would like to describe how we solved particularly important problems, what solutions we developed, how we use them and what problems still need to be addressed by developers. In other words, I would like to describe you the journey we made from HTTP to Kafka-based microservices.

By Ivana Kellyerova

It's often said that Python comes with batteries included, meaning that the standard library can do basically anything except for maybe conjure bacon for you (though I heard that's coming in 3.8). I don't think we fully appreciate the sheer vastness of it, though, so I went through it module by module looking for hidden gems (sorry, eggs). This is a by no means exhaustive compilation of the useful, the underrated, and the funny.

When it comes to the Python standard library, chances are you use it on a daily basis -- or more likely, a more or less stable subset of it. The usual way we add things to the subset is by looking for a solution to a problem and ending up getting pointed to a standard library module. That, however, means that the odds of you finding out that there is a whole module whose sole purpose is to tell you if a string is a Python keyword are very slim.

The aim of this talk is to showcase CPython libraries that are interesting in some way: mostly for their usefulness, but in some cases simply for being wonderfully weird in some way. The talk is not aimed at any particular level of Python experience - as a beginner you'll get a taste of just how many batteries Python ships with, and as a person using the language often you might end up growing your own personal subset a bit more.

I will cover:
- How and where to get the SDK
- How it works and how to use it in general
- Possible use-cases like: Processing Container-Logs, Testing with pytest on different Python Versions, Deploy via Python Script, etc..

For my talk, you should know what Docker is and how to use it.
A basic idea of pytest and server administration is  nice to have, but not necessarily needed to follow my talk.

By Adrian Mönnich

Many Flask projects nowadays still use mostly static HTML, WTForms and just a bit of AJAX. All the JavaScript is usually included straight from .js files or just minified with Python tools like webassets.

But the JavaScript ecosystem has evolved a lot - one can now use tools like Babel to write modern JS even when targeting older browsers and a Webpack+Babel build is very straightforward and allows for advanced preprocessing of JavaScript code.

In this talk we'll even go one step further and not only use Webpack to build the assets, but also integrate a small demo Flask app with a React frontend where the Flask app only serves the static HTML page and uses a RESTful API to communicate with the React app.

We'll also look into how to keep convenient Flask features such as URL building in client-side code (using the js-flask-urls package) and of course React hooks will be used!

h2Parallel computing in Python: Current state and recent advances/h2

Modern hardware is multi-core. It is crucial for Python to provide
high-performance parallelism. This talk will expose to both data-scientists and
library developers the current state of affairs and the recent advances for
parallel computing with Python. The goal is to help practitioners and
developers to make better decisions on this matter.

I will first cover how Python can interface with parallelism, from leveraging
external parallelism of C-extensions –especially the BLAS family– to Python's
multiprocessing and multithreading API. I will touch upon use cases, e.g single
vs multi machine, as well as and pros and cons of the various solutions for
each use case. Most of these considerations will be backed by benchmarks from
the scikit-learn machine
learning library.

From these low-level interfaces emerged higher-level parallel processing
libraries, such as concurrent.futures, joblib and loky (used by dask and
scikit-learn) These libraries make it easy for Python programmers to use safe
and reliable parallelism in their code. They can even work in more exotic
situations, such as interactive sessions, in which Python’s native
multiprocessing support tends to fail. I will describe their purpose as well as
the canonical use-cases they address.

The last part of this talk will focus on the most recent advances in the Python
standard library, addressing one of the principal performance bottlenecks of
multi-core/multi-machine processing, which is data communication. We will
present a new API for shared-memory management between different Python
processes, and performance improvements for the serialization of large Python
objects ( PEP 574, pickle extensions). These performance improvements will be
leveraged by distributed data science frameworks such as dask, ray and pyspark.

By Ben Nuttall

A collaboration between the Raspberry Pi Foundation and the European Space Agency put two Raspberry Pi computers augmented with sensor boards and camera modules on the International Space Station in 2015. Every year we run a series of competitions for kids in schools around Europe to design science experiments using the available sensors.

Mission Zero is a low-barrier challenge where students can run a 1 minute Python program in space to display a message to the astronauts. They have access to the sensors for conditional logic but cannot record data or take photos.

Mission Space Lab is a more involved challenge, including planning an experiment, writing and testing code which will run for 3 hours in space, either studying life in space or life on earth (which includes taking photos of Earth out of the ISS window). MSL teams get to keep the data and photo they record in their experiment and are to write a report analysing their findings.

A small tech team at the Raspberry Pi Foundation maintain the operating system used in flight and work in collaboration with ESA and partners to keep the operation of the Pis running smoothly on the ISS LAN.

As well as sharing details of the OS maintenance and devops for the Astro Pis, I'll share photos taken from space and show findings from student experiments using opencv, tensorflow, scikit-learn, ephem and more.

Have you ever realized how dynamic CPython interpreter is? Maybe it is the most dynamic interpreter you may see. It gives interfaces to internal things like garbage collector or AST, allows to alter functions code, modify built-in functions etc. 

This talk will go beyond that dynamism. From adding a new syntax to hooking the evaluation loop, it will show how to hack parts of python. 

Before understanding these hacks,  you will learn internals of CPython step-by-step. Steps are important because in every step we have at least one hacking option. Also it gives the audience a short brief of how python works. 

After learning how cpython works, we'll cover how to hack (use things that is not their main purpose) the interpreter and the interfaces it gave. For an example we will disassembly the bytecode and then assemble it again with adding our statements or adding a new syntax for python at runtime with AST.

Talk will hack these steps:
- AST
- Bytecode
- CTypes
- CPython evaluation loop

My team has been running AsyncIO in production for over 2 years now and the only thing I can say about my experience with it is: """"Oh boy, what a rollercoaster of feelings"""". I've experienced laughs and tears, sweat and blood but also sang songs of glory. AsyncIO is currently the biggest buzzword in the Python world advertised as a silver bullet capable of solving all Python's shortcomings in the field of performance. However, it also brings a burden of being a completely new approach with a fresh implementation which is not often mentioned and taken into consideration. In some of my team's projects we've achieved a great success thanks to AsyncIO, but there's been a few where we decided to get rid of it and replace it with a more traditional fork-join architecture. I'd like to share my experience with AsyncIO, tell some War Stories and discuss which projects it suits perfectly and which ones should avoid it.

Why
The audience will discover one of the core pieces of the language that sits at the middle of the decisions about what new rules can or cannot be implemented in the Python programming language. They will learn how the particularities of the grammar limit what can be achieved but also serve to maintain the language consistent, powerful but straightforward. Attendants will learn how core developers solved some challenging scenarios that arise as a consequence of said limitations or how others cannot be resolved unless Python gets a significant transformation in the internal mechanism that parses the grammar. Finally, they will learn how a new rule is added to the CPython grammar, serving as a perfect example of how all the pieces come together. In summary, the audience will gain a more technical response to why people perceive the Python programming language as easy but powerful one and at the same time will gain some insight on how to understand and extend the pieces that form it. This talk will not only help members of the audience understand better the design of the language a how grammars and parser work, but will also help people wanting to contribute to CPython understanding the general structure of the compiler pipeline and how to work on it. 

Who
This talk is for those that want to understand Python a bit deeper: not only how everything works under the hood but also what are the technical decisions in its making and what are the consequences. The talk is targeted to all Python programmers, no matter the skill level as everyone will find something for their particular level of expertise:

Beginner programmers will be introduced in the topic of language grammars and will learn what a Grammar is and what are the building blocks. Also, the audience members in this level will gain insight into how everything is thread together in CPython.
Medium and advanced programmers will learn some in-depth technical details and how they relate to features they already know and understand. The talk not only will try to enlight some new areas related to grammar technicalities, parser features and design and CPython implementation details but will also connect many pieces of information to explain how the small technical decisions impact the bigger picture. 


Outline

Who am I

What is the Python Grammar 

What is grammar?
How they look like.
Elements: terminal symbols, nonterminal symbols, productions.

The properties of Python Grammar? 

Leftmost derivation
1 token lookahead
No epsilon productions! (Plus what epsilon productions are)
Some immediate consequences of these properties. 


How the Python parser generator works


General structure of the parser generator.
Non Deterministic Finite Automata
Deterministic Finite Automata.
Some examples (with cool graphs!) generated from the
python grammar and the parser generator of the actual
finite automatas that Python uses.

Advantages of the grammar (or """"why Python is so easy to understand) 


LL(1) grammars are context-free (no state to maintain while parsing).
LL(1) grammars are simple to implement and very fast to parse.
LL(1) grammars are very limited, keeping the language simple


Disadvantages of the grammar:


Grammar ambiguity.
LL(1) grammars need some hacks for very simple things.
How keyword arguments were incorporated in the grammar with a hack: 
The grammar rule is very strange because it is """"fixed"""" in the Abstract syntax tree
Why parenthesized with statements cannot be implemented (with statements 
formed of multiple elements surrounded by parenthesis and separated by commas).


Implementing a new grammar rule in CPython: the arrow operator :


A complete mini-tutorial on how to introduce a new operator: A - B
that gets executed as A.strongrarrow/strong(B).
Altering the grammar and generating the new parser.
Introducing a new token.
Changing the tokenizer.
Changing the Abstract Syntax Tree Generator.
Changing the compiler.
Implementing the new opcode.
Implementing the strongrarrow/strong protocol.


The future and summary of the talk:


We have been discussing in the CPython discourse to change the parser generator to something
more powerful.
Dangers and advantages of other parser generators.

By Stefan Baerisch

Python and Go are a great combination. Like Python, Go is easy to learn, powerful to use and has many useful libraries. Go and Python work great together: Go has better performance and parallelism, while Python is more expressive. Wouldn't it be nice if you could combine the benefits of Go and Python in one program? This talk shows you how.

Why you may want to attend
Extension modules written in C/C++ or other languages are one of the major strength Python. Go is a useful language to extend Python. This talk explains to you how to implement extension modules in Go.

Content of the Talk
The talk shows how to use CGO to make Go code available as a C library and then to use Cython to make this library available as a Python extension module. 

We start by building a wrapper for simple Go code that adds some numbers and returns the results. This program is our end-to-end example to demonstrate the steps necessary to create a Python extension module in Go.
Next, we move to more complex use cases. We look at different ways to share complex data and to use Python callbacks from Go.
Then, we see how to how to handle Go's Garbage Collector when exposing with Go Objects. 
Finally, the talk goes into the advantages and disadvantages of Go as an extension language for Python. We also look at some of the alternative ways to make Go code available in Python.

Recommended Prerequisites
To get the most out of the talk, you should know about the difference between native Python modules and extension modules written in other languages. Some background on concepts like garbage collection, stack and heap, and dynamic/shared libraries are beneficial. Knowledge of the Python C API is not required.
You do not need to know how to write Go code to follow the talk - the talk explains all the required Go.

[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-25 - Fintry [PyData]]
[Edinburgh, UK]

By Isabel Lopez

In an online betting exchange, thousands of money related transactions are generated per minute. This data flow transforms a common and, in general, tedious task such as accounting into an interesting big data engineering problem. At Smarkets, accounting reports serve two main purposes: housekeeping of our financial operations and documentation for the relevant regulation authorities. In both cases, reliability and accuracy are crucial in the final result. The fact that these reports are generated daily, the need to cope with failure when retrieving data from previous days, and the fast growing transaction volume obsoleted the original accounting system and required a new pipeline that could scale.

This talk presents the ETL pipeline designed to meet the constraints highlighted above, and explains the motivations behind the tech stack chosen for the job, which includes Python3, Luigi and Spark among others. These topics will be covered by describing the main technical problems solved with our design:
- Fault tolerance and reliability, i.e ability to identify faulty steps and only rerun those instead of the whole pipeline.
- Fast input/output.
- Fast computations.

[Edinburgh, UK]

By Guillem Duran


Creating huge datasets of top performing examples for Reinforcement Learning (RL) has always been tricky, but if we allow
ourselves to cheat a bit it can be done very easily. During this talk, I will present a new family of algorithms that allow to efficiently generate very high quality samples for any known RL environment.

This new generation of planning algorithms achieves a performance which is several orders of magnitude higher
than any other existing alternative, while offering linear time complexity and good scalability.


This talk will be a practical example
of how we can use new tools for hacking any reinforcement learning environment, and make it generate superhuman level games.

Hacking RL, as any other hacking process will be divided in four phases:

During information gathering, I will briefly explain what are the main ideas behind Reinforcement Learning.
I will also talk about how our theory (FractalAI) came to be, and what are the fundamental concepts behind it.


We will find an attack vector against the environment API, and explain how it can be exploited. I will explain
the fundamental concepts needed to build a new generation of exploits, that will allow us to have complete control over the data the environment produces.


This is the time to test the new exploits and to show a proof of concept. We will exploit the attack vector to gain access
to the environment. Using only a laptop I will show how it is possible to sample data which surpasses human performance way faster than real time.


Once we have gained control of the environment, we will measure how well the exploits work, and how well the techniques presented
can generalize to other types of environments.


I want the talk to be as simple and fast as possible, with a lot of graphical examples, videos, and a Jupyter notebook.
The Q&amp;A session is the time to apply some social engineering to get me to talk about the details that you find more interesting.
I have prepared additional material covering the most common questions and concerns, but feel free to ask whatever you want, I love challenging questions ;)

By Dimiter Naydenov

Learning to use the awesome Pandas toolkit helped me immensely in lots of ways. Finding novel,
efficient solutions to complex day-to-day problems with Pandas not only saves time, but can be fun
and rewarding experience.

In this talk I'll present use cases I had to solve, but the ""traditional"" approach proved tough
and/or otherwise frustrating implement nicely. Since I was just starting to learn Pandas, decided to
try an alternative solution with it. What I learned changed the way I think about data processing
with Python, and it only got better since!

The use cases deals with extracting pen strokes from handwritten SVG samples, and recomposing them
into reusable letters and numbers. When you need to compare each stroke to all others, often more
than once, resulted in inefficient, slow, and hard to maintain code. Even a naive Pandas approach
with loops helped to reduce both the memory footprint, and improve the performance considerably!
Improving the implementation further, vectorizing inner loops, and taking advantage of multi-index
operations, I managed to get the same results, using less memory and a lot faster (by orders of
magnitude).

By Antonia Mey

In the last ten years scientists working on computational problems involving proteins and other small molecules have largely moved to using python when developing simulation and data analysis tools allowing for a fast prototyping and development of new ideas. One big challenge is dealing with the compatibility of different tools and using these to create very complex adaptive, yet robust workflows in order to be able to guide cutting edge experiments e.g. predicting how well a small drug like molecule can bind to a protein that could serve as a target for a new drug. The talk will give a gentle introduction to what kind of python related tools are available in the field  of computational molecular biology, how they are used, and what kind of complex workflows scientist have to solve.
I will then introduce BioSimSpace an open source python library and flagship project of the CCPBioSim consortium in the UK, which provides a common API to avoid having to learn many individual tools facing compatibility and dependency challenges allowing scientists to focus on the scientific question at hand and not solving programming challenges. BioSimSpace allows fast and interoperable building of workflow components (nodes) for bimolecular problems, which can easily be used on a variety of different computational resources. In particular I will introduce the cloud facilities available for fast prototyping using a Jupyter notebook interface.

[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-25 - Smarkets]
[Edinburgh, UK]

By Ronan Lamy

PyPy is a fast and compliant implementation of Python. In other words, it's an interpreter for the Python language that can act as a full replacement for the reference interpreter, CPython. It's optimised to enable efficient just-in-time compilation of Python code to machine code, and has releases matching versions 2.7, 3.5 and soon(ish) 3.6. The PyPy project also developed cffi as a clean and efficient way of interfacing with C code.

However, many libraries in the Python ecosystem are implemented as C extensions, which target CPython's C API. Many others use Cython, which builds C extensions under the hood. Therefore, PyPy needs an emulation layer for the C API. 

This emulation needs to bridge the differences between the implementation languages and the object models of CPython and PyPy. The solution is called cpyext. It's implemented in a mixture of RPython and C, with most of the API functions and macros implemented in RPython. cpyext exposes PyObjects to the extension code that appear similar to CPython objects (as long as extension writers stay within the fuzzily defined boundaries of the public API) but are merely 'shadows' of the real PyPy objects.

After a brief presentation of PyPy, its goals, and its current statuts and roadmap, this talk will dive into the vexed topic of its handling of C extensions.  By the end of it, the audience should understand the operating principles of cpyext and have a clearer understanding of what happens when you install and run numpy, for instance, on top of PyPy. Some basic familiarity with CPython internals and how C extensions are made will be assumed.

This talk will aim to demystify quantum computing and will assume no prior knowledge. The speaker, while having studied Quantum Field Theory many years ago, has only relatively recently started learning properly about  Quantum Computing, and is going to try to take advantage of the fact that the ideas are relatively new to him to explain the key concepts simply, to an audience (probably) consisting mostly of non-experts in quantum computing.

Key questions I will try to cover are likely to include
  * What is quantum mechanics anyway?
  * What are quantum computers? Are they real? And are they really faster/more powerful than classical computers?
  * What is a qubit (the quantum computing analogue of a bit)
  * What problems are likely to be solved well by quantum computers?
  * How do you program a quantum computer?
  * How do you get results out of a quantum computer? What kind of results are they anyway? Do you have to visit other universes to get them?
  * Can you get access to quantum computers online and use Python to program them (kind-of!)
  * Will quantum computers break all encryption?
  * What are Shor's and Grover's algorithms and (just possibly) how do they work?
  * What are the challenges with building practical quantum computers?
  * What is the Python story with Quantum Computing?

Is your system stable? Do you know what happens if any of your system's dependency will start failing? Do you even know what exactly each part of your system does or did any time in the past? Or how fast you will identify root of the problem in case your system goes down at 2am?

The talk focuses on distributed systems (microservices, APIs that communicate with databases, memory, third party services, etc.), monitoring, their failures and recovery in order to help you answer yourself questions above.

First part aims on importance of monitoring such systems on several levels - monitoring of hardware, application monitoring, monitoring from outside of the systems, detecting malfunctions based on anomalies within system's data flows.

Second part presents several standard techniques for preventing system failure in case of outage of dependency and technique how to recover from inconsistent state after outage.

Content of presentation is helpful and interesting for beginners and intermediates. Senior developers and developers working on reliable distributed systems should bear in mind content of this presentation and master shown techniques.

To understand recursion you must first understand recursion. Alternatively, you could come to a talk that will demonstrate the basics of recursion, using fractals drawn by the python turtle module! 

What are fractals? Fractals are psychedelic designs that appear basically the same regardless of scale. They also appear all over nature–consider how a tree trunk and branches is similar in structure to branches and twigs or how a wave is made of mini waves. Best of all, fractals can be constructed using recursive functions. 

What is the turtle module? It is part of the standard python library that can be used to draw amazing things and is commonly used as a tool for learning to code.

Come for the recursion, stay for the amazing fractals, and leave knowing that no turtles were harmed in the making of this talk.

This talk is suitable for all python enthusiasts. Those who love mathematics will love this talk. Advanced developers will learn more about a tool that can be used to teach people to code. There is something for everyone.

TLS/SSL is the most important and widely-used protocol for secure and encrypted communication, e.g. HTTPS. It offers more than just encryption. TLS also ensures data integrity and strong authentication with X.509 certificates. But it provides merely a false sense of security, if you use it wrong.

Have you ever encountered ssl.SSLError: [SSL: CERTIFICATE em VERIFY/ em FAILED], while connecting to a server, but you didn’t understand what is going on? Are you running production code without TLS/SSL protection or with certificate validation disabled, because you couldn’t figure out how to make it work correctly?

I’ll give you the rundown of the basic cryptographic building blocks, protocol handshake, inner structure of certificates, and PKI. You’ll learn about the best practices, debugging tools and tips how to diagnose TLS/SSL and how to deal with certificates.

The clock is ticking on Python 2.7, with support to be dropped in January 2020.  With major dependencies such as Django, NumPy and pandas moving to Python 3 only, the time has come for even big established codebases to consider upgrading.  Many organisations are still postponing for various reasons; we will attempt to demonstrate that with a bit of planning and perseverance, and the assistance of some handy tools, we can embrace the future!

This session will provide a first-hand perspective on how we upgraded a large (~65,000 lines of python code) 8-year-old Django project with multiple external dependencies from Python 2.7 to Python 3.6.

We will briefly discuss the benefits of upgrading to Python 3, and architectural considerations.  The session will primarily focus on the practicalities of upgrading the code itself.  We will not try to provide a single “best” solution for upgrading to Python 3, but rather will introduce some of the available tools, provide an insight into how we used them, and their advantages and disadvantages from our experience.  We will discuss preparatory steps and approaches, strategies for dealing with external dependencies, and “gotchas” that we encountered during the process.

The aim of this session is to provide an example of how a Python 3 upgrade on an established commercial product can be successfully completed, and to furnish audience members with a set of tools and strategies to help them with their own projects.  

Prerequisites: basic knowledge of Python.

Have you ever tried optimizing a super-slow Python application and thought: “Oh! I wish I could just write this bit it in Rust”? Well, turns out you can!
We will show you how Rust is a better alternative than C to make your programs lightning fast, and how to get away with it; without your users even noticing.

As Infrastructure Engineers at Yelp, the challenge we face everyday is: scale. Yelp is mostly a Python shop and while this is great for development velocity, our work often revolves around making Python applications run faster. Until now, we have been using different techniques: faster interpreters, or, more often, C code.

Given its safety guarantees, performance and promise of better tooling than C, we decided we had to give Rust a try. The initial results helped reinforce that there was a lot of opportunity for Rust to play an important role in our production code.

Yelp heavily relies on the Apache Avro (https://avro.apache.org/) serialization format for its internal infrastructure. During the talk, we will show how we implemented an Avro serialization/deserialization library in Rust, how we were able to call it from Python (and in theory from any other language) with very little code, using tools such as cbindgen (https://github.com/eqrion/cbindgen/), CFFI (https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and Milksnake (https://github.com/getsentry/milksnake/).

This talk would outline how easy it is to write performant code in a language like Rust and call it from Python applications without users even realizing it, making this a great solution for production services.

By Daniele Procida

Since Picasso encountered Henri Rousseau over a century ago, modern art has been acutely aware of the value of the contributions that the naïve artist can make. Art negotiates the relationship between sophistication and naïvety with care and intelligence.

What does our programming culture make of the naïve programmer?  What can programming gain or learn from this encounter? 

The naïve programmer is simply an unsophisticated programmer. Nobody is born sophisticated. Even the most sophisticated programmers were once naïve programmers. What's more, the adoption of programming simply as a tool to solve immediate problems, by ever more people without any formal training, means that the number of naïve programmers will become greater, not less. Are we ready for this?

This talk will explore the relationship, illuminating it with examples from the world of painting, art and music, and will offer some lessons that our own industry and culture should be ready to learn from.

(This talk will already have been presented as a keynote at DjangoCon Europe 2018)

[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-25 - Lammermuir]
[Edinburgh, UK]

By Almar Klein

WebAssembly (WASM) is an open, low level binary format designed to be compact and run at native speed, while being memory-safe. WASM is primarily intended to run code in browsers, but its by no means limited to this. This makes it an interesting intermediate language (IR); code that compiles to WASM will (in the future) run basically anywhere. In short: WASM is coming and its great!

Unsurprisingly, WASM is being embraced by many communities, such as C++, Rust, Lua, and .NET. Sadly, there does not seem to be a lot of enthusiasm from the Python community yet…

Perhaps this is because Python is interpreted and can therefore not (easily) use WASM as a compilation target. It should be possible to compile a Python interpreter (like CPython or Pypy) to WASM and thereby run Python code in a browser. But the result would be pretty heavy-weight, so it would arguably not be a very practical.

Within the PPCI project (a pure Python compiler infrastructure) tooling has been developed to load, inspect, compile and even run WASM modules. This allows combining WASM and Python in new ways. In this talk we discuss two approaches by which the Python community might embrace WASM. 

Firstly, various projects already exist that compile Python functions to other languages (e.g. Numba, PScript), and we have type annotations. If Python functions would be compiled to WASM, the resulting code would run in any WASM runtime (e.g. the browser). This will be demonstrated with an example, for which the resulting code can be run either in a browser or inside Python itself. In either case, it’s pretty darn fast.

Secondly, rather than em using /em WASM, it might be interesting for Python to function as a platform to em run /em  and 
 em bind /em  WASM modules. Two of Python’s greater strengths are its rich ecosystem and its ability to glue things together. Let’s build on that! Imagine creating an application that consists of multiple WASM modules, perhaps compiled from different languages, and binding these together into a single Python app.

This will be demonstrated with a game, which is written in Rust, compiled to WASM, and running inside a Python process. The WASM module consumes a drawing API, which is in this case provided by Python, and Python feeds the WASM module with user input.

I hope that this talk inspires other Pythonistas to think about the advantages that WASM can bring to our ecosystem, and also about the role that Python can play in the growing WASM ecosystem.

[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-25 - Moorfoot]
[Edinburgh, UK]

By Yury Selivanov

The talk is aimed to give attendees a clear picture of new asyncio features in Python 3.7 and give an idea of what to expect in Python 3.8.  As a CPython core developer and the lead asyncio maintainer I believe I have a unique perspective to share with EuroPython guests.

Python 3.7 boasts a number of new amazing features: 


sendfile
start TLS
new high performance buffered protocols
context-local state via PEP 567
asyncio.run &amp; create_task &amp; other usability improvements
many performance improvements


The first part of the talk will be focusing on new APIs to explain them and give ideas how they can be used in production.

The second part of the talk will be focused on what to expect to see in asyncio in Python 3.8:


new performance tracking &amp; profiling API
supervisors &amp; cancel scopes
new timeouts API
a completely new way of writing asyncio applications


Some of these ideas are borrowed from Trio and Curio (two other popular async/await Python frameworks), many are borrowed from languages like Erlang and Scala. One thing I can say for certain is that 3.8 will be the biggest and most interesting asyncio release ever!

By Steve Dower

Packages that won't install, encodings that don't work, installers that ask too many questions, and having to own a PC are all great reasons to just ignore Windows. Or they would be, if they were true.
Despite community perception, more than half of Python usage still happens on Windows, including web development, system administration, and data science, just like on Linux and Mac. And for the most part, Python works the same regardless of what operating system you happen to be using. Still, many library developers will unnecessarily exclude half of their potential audience by not even attempting to be compatible.
This session will walk through the things to be aware of when creating cross-platform libraries. From simple things like using pathlib rather than bytestrings, through to all the ways you can get builds and tests running on Windows for free, by the end of this session you will have a checklist of easy tasks for your project that will really enable the whole Python world to benefit from your work.

Have you ever tried to manage deployment of multiple python applications through various
linux distributions ? If so, you must have heard of Docker and maybe also Kubernetes.
Distributing python applications using docker is simple and allows to create static packages
containing everything required for them to run. Also it allows to freeze everything, packages, available
libraries, files on filesystem.
In my speech I would like to tell you about our brief journey, of moving our trading platform
from standalone application directly on host system, through deploying it in docker and latter
moving it to kubernetes. I will explain our struggles with implementing stable and fast CI using Gitlab CI and Docker,
image (package) storage and cleanup of old images and finally I will tell you how we are deploying
our platform to kubernetes, with nothing more than yaml-s and templating.

Over the years, I've led, and been a member of, numerous technical teams on a wide variety of projects. Based on that experience, this talk will describe my personal observations on the role of the leader in that sort of team.

The talk will be in 5 sections:


Introduction - A bit about my background so you can judge whether to bother staying for the rest.

Authority - Where it comes from and the challenges you might face depending on the answer.
Priorities - What should you be focussing upon?
Style - There are many leadership styles, but what's yours and what's appropriate for technical teams?
Process - What's your role in defining and managing process?



There is no prior knowledge or experience required whatsoever. The talk is aimed equally at anyone  considering a leadership role for the first time or who has been doing so for many years.

Autism is a condition that correlates with engineering.  Many people in the industry are diagnosed autistic, undiagnosed autistic, or near autistic.  There are many lessons that can be learned from how to deal with autistic people that are very useful in our industry.  These lessons are often also useful when dealing with non-autistic people.  There are many lessons on how to deal with your own autism that are useful to undiagnosed autistic people and near autistic people.

We will cover the basics of autism, and related conditions.  We will cover simple tricks that can make discussions and changes easier in workplaces (""10 Simple tricks to make your autistic colleagues shout less!"").  We will also cover techniques you can use for dealing with your own autistic tendencies (""100 coping mechanisms to pretend that you are normal!"").

I am a late diagnosis autistic person myself, and will discuss the difference between knowing and not knowing that you are autistic.

reno is a tool for managing release notes in projects that support multiple branches of development, and releases, simultaneously. It solves the problem of managing release notes within patches that fix bugs, and makes it easier to cherry-pick changes between branches (allowing backports or forward ports). This talk will cover the requirements, and constraints, that led us to design and build reno. I will also show how to use it to create notes and publish them in your packages and via Sphinx-based documentation. Then I will talk about the impact reno, and the release notes publishing automation, had on our project and release processes.

A profile is a set of statistics that describes how often and for how long various parts of the program executed. Most profilers run inside your Python process.  If you’re inside a Python program you generally have pretty easy access to its stack, hence we can gather information about time spent in each level.

In this talk we'll build a Python profiler from scratch and so learn about the dynamic nature of Python and how do well-known profilers such as cProfile. 

We'll also learn the difference between a tracing and a sampling profiler and which one to use in what circumstance.

By Hrafn Eiriksson

Much has been written about asynchronous programming in Python, especially after the introduction of asyncio into the standard library of the language. We've all seen the benchmarks that tell us how asyncio-powered web servers massively outperform their non-asyncio counterparts for trivial routes and we've seen the articles that tell us how to make the move from flask to aiohttp and why we should. 

Despite all of this, the question remains: How is it to use asyncio in a production setting? What are the pain points of migrating a large application to use asyncio? How does the performance of this real-world application differ after the migration? Is it still just unicorns and fairy tales? The goal of this talk is to address these questions. 

If you are curious about taking the step from asyncio-dabbling to creating actual mission critical software systems in asyncio; this is the talk for you!

By Emmanuel Leblond

Concurrent programs are super useful: think of web apps juggling lots
of simultaneous downloads and websocket connections, chat bots
tracking multiple concurrent conversations, or web spiders fetching
pages in parallel. But writing concurrent programs is complicated,
intimidating to newcomers, and often challenging even for experts.

Does it have to be? Python is famous for being simple and
straightforward; can Python make concurrent programming simple and
straightforward too?
Trio is an attempt to address this question by the positive !

By taking advantage of new Python 3 features (async/await keywords,
async loops and context managers etc.) while dropping legacy concepts that
older asynchronous frameworks has to maintain, Trio defines a new set of
primitives that make it dramatically easier to write correct concurrent programs.

In this talk, we will describe those primitives, and demonstrate how to
use them to implement a basic algorithm for speeding up TCP connections.
Compared to the best previous Python implementation, our version turns out to
be easier to understand, more correct, and dramatically shorter.

By Andrey Vlasovskikh

A microcontroller unit is a CPU, memory modules, and I/O devices on a single chip. There are tens of billions of microcontrollers in world: they are everywhere from watches to cars. Developers program them mostly in C, since their tiny hardware resources make it very hard to use higher-level langauges such as Python. In 2014 the MicroPython project was started with the goal of making it possible to program microcontrollers in Python.

Was it hard to make Python work on a device with only 16 KB of RAM? Is MicroPython a Python dialect or is it a different language? I'll start with the most important optimizations and the key differences in the language implementation to give you an idea of what MicroPython really is.

Most of us are not contributors to MicroPython though and it's much more important for us to understand how Python coding for microcontrollers is different from, say, web development or scripting. What do you need to learn in order to program your mictrocontroller-based IoT devices? I'll talk about several traits of Python coding for microcontrollers that make it different, but exciting to learn.

By Yenny Cheung

Does your code smell? Have a weird fragrance? It turns out code smells are a real thing and an amazing conceptualization of suboptimal design. This talk helps you identify code smells in Python. It also shows you how to wash them away by the technique of refactoring. You will learn the art of writing Pythonic, clean and maintainable code.

Code smells refer to the symptoms of problematic code design. Identifying different types of code smells is the first step to successful refactoring. I will talk through some classic examples:


Unnecessary long and complex code
Using mutable data structures
Uncommunicative naming
Coupled code


Knowing what to refactor, I will share a few learnings that lead to good quality code:


The boy scout rule: always leave the code cleaner than you found it
Pythonic data structures: Enum, Namedtuple
The art of naming
DRY and the separation of concerns principle


I will also share tips on using refactoring at your company, which includes convincing your product manager, looking out for code smells during code reviews, and employing automatic tools.

The speaker has previously presented on Talk Python To Me Podcast: https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/150/technical-lessons-learned-from-pythonic-refactoring, and at PyCon.DE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq9-b2JKUyU.

Why would you ever need to use decorators in Python? 
Have you ever had the task when you need to use one function in few places and you really wanted to avoid of code duplicating? For example to add some logging into functions or timers, etc. Decorators in Python are super powerful with these tasks, but at the same time they are super complicated, sometimes even magical. When I started learning Python, Decorators were really like a magic: how to use them, how are they working, lots of questions. The goal is to make the things easier and clear to answer a question: to use or not to use Decorators in your project. 
What’s in the Talk: 
- Functions nature in Python 
- Magic of a Decorator 
- Basics 
- When to use Decorators 
- Examples 
- Even more Python magic

[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-25 - PyCharm [PyData]]
[Edinburgh, UK]

By Florian Wilhelm

A recent but quite common observation in industry is that although there is an overall high adoption of data science, many companies struggle to get it into production. Huge teams of well-payed data scientists often present one fancy model after the other to their managers but their proof of concepts never manifest into something business relevant. The frustration grows on both sides, managers and data scientists.

In my talk I elaborate on the many reasons why data science to production is such a hard nut to crack. I start with a taxonomy of data use cases in order to easier assess technical requirements. Based thereon, my focus lies on overcoming the two-language-problem which is Python/R loved by data scientists vs. the enterprise-established Java/Scala. From my project experiences I present three different solutions, namely 1) migrating to a single language, 2) reimplementation and 3) usage of a framework. The advantages and disadvantages of each approach is presented and general advices based on the introduced taxonomy is given. 

Additionally, my talk also addresses organisational as well as problems in quality assurance and deployment. Best practices and further references are presented on a high-level in order to cover all facets of data science to production.

With my talk I hope to convey the message that breakdowns on the road from data science to production are rather the rule than the exception, so you are not alone. At the end of my talk, you will have a better understanding of why your team and you are struggling and what to do about it.

[Edinburgh, UK]

By Eulalia Veny

The analysis of text data in social media is gaining more and more importance every day. The need for companies to know what people think and want is key to invest money in providing customers what they want. The first approach to text analysis was mainly statistical, but adding linguistic information has been proven to work well for improving the results.

One of the problems that you need to address when analyzing social media is time. People are constantly exchanging information, users write comments every day about what they think of a product, what they do or the places they visit. It is difficult to keep track of everything that happens. Moreover, information is sometimes expressed in short sentences, keywords, or isolated ideas, such as in Tweets. Language is usually unstructured because it is composed of isolated ideas, or without context.

I will talk about the problem of text analysis in social media. I will also explain briefly Naïve Bayes classifiers, and how you can easily take advantage of them to analyse sentiment in social media, and I will use an example to show how linguistic information can help improve the results. I will also evaluate the pros and cons of supervised vs unsupervised learning.

Finally, I will introduce opinion lexicons, both dictionary based and corpus-based, and how lexicons can be used in semi-supervised learning and supervised learning. If I have time left, I will explain about other use cases of text analysis.

By Elisabetta Bergamini

For most travellers, online reviews play a major role when it comes to choosing which hotel to stay in. But can we actually trust a hotel review? And if yes, how can we select which are the most meaningful and interesting for us among the billions available in platforms such as Booking.com, Tripadvisor, Facebook (just to mention a few)?
For 10 years now, at TrustYou we have built processes that analyze terabytes of hotel reviews at a global scale, and strive to understand what people complain about or like in the hotels worldwide.
Dealing with a huge amount of reviews written in tens of different languages - each having its own subtle shades of meanings - is the challenge we work on everyday. In this talk, we will show what goes on behind the scenes of the TrustYou Metareview and dive into the technologies and the algorithms that allow us to provide travellers with all the information they need to find the perfect hotel.

[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-25 - PyCharm [PyData]]
[Edinburgh, UK]

By Cheuk Ting Ho

Matching strings should be one of the first natural language processing problem that human encounter since we start use computer to handle data. Unlike numerical value which has an exact logic to compare them, it is very hard to say how alike two strings are for a computer. One may compare them character by character and have an idea of how many characters in the pair of stings are the same. Unfortunately in most application we need computer to perceive strings like we do and therefore we have to use fuzzy matching. Fuzzy matching on names is never straight forward though, the definition of how “difference” of two names are really depends case by case. For example with restaurant names, matching of words like “cafe” “bar” and “restaurant” are consider less valuable then matching of some other less common words. Also, do we consider company names that matches partly (like “Happy Unicorn company” and Happy Unicorn co.”) are the same?

In the first half of the talk Levenshtein Distance, a measure of the similarity between two strings, will be explained. Different functions in Fuzzywuzzy like “partial em ratio” and “token/em sort_ratio” will also be explored and compared for difference. It is very important to understand our tool and choose the right one for our task. Then in the second half, we will start tackling the example problem: matching company names, we will show that besides using Fuzzywuzzy, we have to also handle problem like finding and avoid matching of common words and speeding up the matching process by grouping the names. By combining all tricks and techniques that we demonstrate, we will also evaluate how efficient this method is and the advantage of using this method.

This talk is for people in all level of Python experience who would like to learn a trick or two and would like to be able to solve similar problems in the future. Theory of how the library works will be explained and It is easy to be pick up even for beginners.

By Anmol Krishan Sachdeva

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have become famous over time due to their property of retaining internal memory. These neural nets are widely used in recognizing patterns in sequences of data, like numerical timer series data, images, handwritten text, spoken words, genome sequences, and much more. Since these nets possess memory, there is a certain analogy that we can make to the human brain in order to learn how RNNs work. RNNs can be thought of as a network of neurons with feedback connections, unlike feedforward connections which exist in other types of Artificial Neural Networks.

The flow of talk will be as follows: - Self Introduction - Introduction to Deep Learning - Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) - Diving DEEP into Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) - Comparing Feedforward Networks with Feedback Networks - Quick walkthrough: Implementing RNNs using Python (Keras) - Understanding Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) and Vanishing Gradient Problem - Towards more sophisticated RNNs: Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)/Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs) - End of talk - Questions and Answers Session

By Peter Hoffmann

Apache Parquet Data Format

Apache Parquet is a binary, efficient columnar data format. It uses various
techniques to store data in a CPU and I/O efficient way like row groups,
compression for pages in column chunks or dictionary encoding for columns.
Index hints and statistics to quickly skip over chunks of irrelevant data
enable efficient queries on large amount of data.

Apache Parquet with Pandas &amp; Dask

Apache Parquet files can be read into Pandas DataFrames with the two libraries
fastparquet and Apache Arrow. While Pandas is mostly used to work with data
that fits into memory, Apache Dask allows us to work with data larger then memory
and even larger than local disk space. Data can be split up into partitions
and stored in cloud object storage systems like Amazon S3 or Azure Storage.

Using Metadata from the partiton filenames, parquet column statistics and
dictonary filtering allows faster performance for selective queries without
reading all data. This talk will show how use partitioning, row group skipping 
and general data layout to speed up queries on large amount of data.

There is no want of technologies for doing scientific calculations in Python. In this talk I will share some hard-learned knowledge about what works and what doesn't with the libraries we are using at GEM (the Global Earthquake Model foundation).
I will show how the following libraries fare with respect to our main concerns of performance, simplicity, reliability and portability


and I will talk about several library bugs we found and had to work around. I will also talk about some libraries that we do not use (such as cython, numba, dask, pytables, ...) and the reason why we do not use them.
Hopefully this will be useful to people using or planning to use a similar software stack.

Concordia Station is a French/Italian facility located inside Antarctica, in a plateau called Dome-C, in the middle of nowhere. A dark and cold place: no Sun from May to August, temperatures around -80 Celsius degress, no life. Here I am living and performing scientific research with other 12 collegues from Italy, France and Austria. We are the most isolated people on Earth, more than the austronauts in the International Space Station. There is no way to move from Concordia until November, and no one can come. It is like to live in another planet, and that is why the European Space Agency is interested in making bio-medical research on us, in order to better understand how the human body behaves in a such extraterrestrial environment. We will introduce our studies, describe this place and our life here, and of course also speak about Python.

By Stefan Behnel

Cython is not only a very fast and comfortable way to talk to native code and libraries, it is also a widely used tool for speeding up Python code. The Cython compiler translates Python code to C or C++ code, and applies many static optimisations that make Python code run visibly faster than in the interpreter. But even better, it supports static type annotations that allow direct use of C/C++ data types and functions, which the compiler uses to convert and optimise the code into fast, native C. The tight integration of all three languages, Python, C and C++, makes it possible to freely mix Python features like generators and comprehensions with C/C++ features like native data types, pointer arithmetic or manually tuned memory management in the same code.

This talk by a core developer introduces the Cython compiler by interactive code examples, and shows how you can use it to speed up your Python code. You will learn how you can profile a Python module and use Cython to compile and optimise it into a fast binary extension module. All of that, without losing the ability to run it through common development tools like static analysers or coverage test tools.

Django structure for scale and longevity

Why

Django is great.

But as we add new features, as our dev team grows &amp; the software needs to be stable on production, things can get quite messy.

We are going to look at some common patterns, derived from experience, on how to structure your Django project for scale and longevity.

What

Main topics are:


Django service layer or where should business logic live?
Using Django Rest Framework in a clean &amp; repeatable way &amp; combining it with the service layer.
Testing everything that matters, without repeating ourselves in different tests.


We are going to talk about when to rely on existing abstraction so it's actually helpful &amp; when to avoid existing abstraction, and code things ourselves.

The examples showed in this talk are derived from working with Django in the last 5 years on projects with:


Daily production usage &amp; production deploys.
Dozens of apps.
Hundreds of models &amp; APIs.
Tens of integrations working simultaneously.
Teams of 5 to 10 people.


Who
Key takeaways from the talk:


Increased productivity when developing with Django.
Deeper understanding of the software development process with Django.
Demo project with everything mentioned in it.


The talk is great for all levels of Django knowledge - from beginners to advanced users &amp; teams.

How

The main way of getting the point across is going to be by showing regular code, talking how it can get messy &amp; then following up with examples of improving that code. Hopefully this talk will start a lot of discussion afterwards.

Breakdown of the talk:


Django service layer

Fat models or fat views?
Where do I put my business logic?
What is a service &amp; what goes into a service?
What is a selector &amp; what goes into a selector?

General Django structure

How many apps should I have?
Structuring your code so youр team can be more productive and have less conflicts.
Common modules &amp; utilities.

Doing APIs with Django Rest Framework

Splitting APIs in 2 groups - ""giving data"" and ""taking data""
Using a lot of generics for ""give data""
When do to selectors?
Using no generics for ""take data"" (APIView + Services)
Handling errors from services
Inlining serializers &amp; avoiding serializers reuse
A neat inline_serializer util
Introducing general error formatting for your API

Testing all of that - what should be &amp; not be tested?

[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-26 - Moorfoot]
[Edinburgh, UK]

By Naomi Ceder

Using for loops and list comprehensions in Python is basic and quite common, right? But how does iteration in Python actually work ""under the hood""? The words ""iterator"" and ""iterable"" each occur over 500 times in the Python documentation, but what does an iterator actually do, as opposed to an iterable? And how do they do it? Learn the details as we turn the iteration protocol inside out, with live coded demonstrations along the way.

This talk will start from the way Python iterates of over a sequence, in comparison with iterating by index, like C. The key point of iterating over a sequence is that something needs to track which item in the sequence is next, which is something that Python's  iteration protocol manages.

The iterable section will demonstrate creating a simple object that returns items by index (e.g., a fibonacci series), showing that getitem is really all you need for an iterable, since an iterator is created for such objects when iterated upon. BUT, this doesn't answer the question of how Python keeps track of which item is next.

The iterator section answers that question by converting the iterable just created to an iterator - adding iter and next methods and showing how the iterator saves state and essentially drives the iteration protocol. 

Having an accurate understanding of iteration protocol will help developing Pythonistas reason better about both iterating over existing objects and creating their own iterables and iterators.

Ever wondered if you should try type checking in your Python project, or what it takes to get started with mypy? I will show how to introduce type checking the easy way, one step at a time.

Dropbox was an early adopter of type checking and mypy, and we've been gradually adding type annotations to our large production codebases since 2016. Engineers love how type annotations improve the clarity of code, and how mypy can surface hard-to-find bugs. We've learned a lot in the process of annotating millions of lines of code, and in this talk you'll learn battle-tested approaches for adding type checking to an existing codebase.

I expect no previous experience with mypy. You'll benefit the most if you've worked on a project with multiple developers.

By Jose Manuel Ortega

Monoliths, microservices and now Serverless. Function as a Service (FaaS) platforms give us new ways to attack old problems. The possibility of executing functions as a service allows designing scalable and highly parallel applications, but on the other hand, this kind of applications require a particular programming style. For example, bundling dependencies and managing state is not trivial.

However, there are plenty of tools and frameworks to help you code serverless applications with Python, and once you get started it is not complicated.

In this talk we will mention the advantages of Serverless and we will focus on the situations in which we can introduce it into our Python projects. We will use AWS Lambda for the examples.

These could be the main talking points:

Introducing Serverless and Function as a Service (FaaS) in Python projects
Advantages of Microservices and Serverless 
AWS Lambda functions with chalice

[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-26 - Lammermuir]
[Edinburgh, UK]

By Steve Barnes

One of the core concepts of Application Development, (not just in python), is the separation between the Business Logic and the User Interface. However there is a strong temptation to start with the user interface and add the business logic to it some methodologies emphasize this with the process of prototyping the (G)UI first. The danger is that your business logic code can get too entangled with the UI and a change of platform or framework becomes almost impossible.

This presentation will show how to maintain a clear separation between the Business Logic and the User Interface by starting with a command line interface using argparse and growing a GUI on top.

We will cover:
 - Why maintain the seperation
 - Using argparse
 - Adding a GUI layer with wxPython
 - Automating the GUI generation
 - Adding a web interface
 - Testing advantages of this approach
 - Scripting advantages
 - Some packaging models.

[Edinburgh, UK]

By Nina Zakharenko

As teams and projects grow, code review becomes increasingly important to support the maintainability of complex codebases. In this talk, I'll cover guidelines for writing consistent python code beyond pep8, how to look out for common python gotchas, and what python tools are available to automate various parts of the review process. Most importantly, I'll cover the human aspect of code reviews - how we can be better at approaching reviews with empathy and understanding from the perspective of both a reviewer and a submitter. Following these successful code review practices will lead to happier teams and healthier code bases.

This talk is useful for python developers with any amount of experience. No prerequisite knowledge is necessary. 
- For those who are just starting out, it will be a great general overview.
- Intermediate developers may not know about the wide variety of tooling that's available.
- Advanced developers will learn techniques for performing code reviews with empathy.

This talk will enable you to have better code reviews on your teams at work, and a better approach to code reviews in open source projects. You'll leave with 3 main takeaways:
 1. Code Reviews are most effective when conducted with empathy. If you do reviews with growth and learning in mind, they become tools for sharing knowledge instead of an opportunity to bruise egos or show off esoteric knowledge.
 2. Python has powerful tooling available for code reviews such as pep8 as a style guide, pylint as a linter, coverage.py to identify test coverage, and vulture to identify dead code.
 3. That python style guides beyond pep8 have clear benefits in terms of producing more consistent code that's easier to review and easier to maintain.

[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-26 - Lammermuir]
[Edinburgh, UK]

By Martin Angelov

I'm currently working in a Django project, We have a lot of tests (~ 2000) and a fair amount of code coverage currently. The system and the requirements of the client grows everyday (like in every other project these days). I've convinced that the effort we put in making each of these tests pays off daily.

Speaking with other Django and Python developers I've noticed that people often ""overengineer"" their unit tests and they usually tend to break their principles.

In this presentation I will talk mainly about unit tests. - what packages we use and how and when to use them (properly). We will take a look on how we structure our projects and how this structure actually helps us write proper unit tests. I will start with the very basic tests and continue with the mocking technique. In the end I'm going to refer to other testing methods (integration, E2E, validation testing,  visual regression, etc.).

The goal of this talk is to make people better in testing and to show them how these skills will fasten the development process and  help them maintain their project and it's quality.

This talk is aimed at those that have at least intermediate experience in Python and have played around with asynchronous Python using asyncio or other libraries. I want the audience to learn from my mistakes! For instance, how easy it is to get into “callback hell” (and how to avoid/get out of it), how to screw up thread safety and deadlock yourself, and making code async but not actually concurrent.

I'll talk through some anti-patterns and best practices that I learned the hard way. This includes proper concurrency, calling coroutines from synchronous code, working with threads and threadsafety, properly shutting down an async programs, and hidden ""gotchas"".

Modern web-apps require bi-directional communication, reacting not only to user actions but also to server events. This can be achieved elegantly using Web Sockets, a protocol standardized by W3C to be a default tool for full-duplex connections on the Web.

Although most web-frameworks do not support Web Socket integration out of the box, Python has multiple options available making it a piece of cake. This talk showcases integrating Web Sockets in Python web-apps, focusing on situations that can make good use of it and presenting implementations with most popular frameworks: Tornado and Django. We will explore a similar style but different underlying technologies of both, and finish with a live demo.

Join us for a Phileas Fogg inspired whirlwind tour of eight Python web frameworks.

""Had he programmed? It was likely, for no one seemed to know web frameworks more familiarly; there was no framework so obscure that he did not appear to have an intimate acquaintance with it. He must have developed in everything, at least in the spirit.""

We'll start with the current crop of microframeworks, showing how to achieve the same task in each, before progressing to ""Batteries included"" and the more specialised async frameworks.

For developers who perhaps have only used a single framework, this talk gives them an opportunity to get out and explore the world (of web frameworks) and broaden their horizons, with plenty of Jules Verne inspired fun along the way.

Having a hard time keeping track of where the modern JavaScript is going? Are you familiar only with jQuery and you want to know more? Or maybe you’re not familiar with JavaScript at all and want to learn it but you don’t know where to start? Then this talk is for you!

You’ll learn about modern JavaScript from a perspective of a Python developer. By the end of the talk you’ll know everything you need to know about the language, its ecosystem, and different tools and frameworks. You’ll be able to start using JavaScript more confidently and be familiar with different tools that are at your disposal.

We’ll go over all the things I wish I'd known when I first got started with JavaScript.:


Basics of the language (types, operators, data structures, functions, modules, etc.) and how they are similar to or different from Python.  
Overview of the commonly used development and build tools.  
Overview of the popular frontend frameworks.  
A look into the newest features and Typescript.  
How to get started and make sense of everything with so much going on.

Rust is a fairly new programming language aimed as a competitor of C.
There are already attempts to write extension modules in rust and load
them into CPython. A whole new approach would be to re-implement the Python
language in rust.

This is what the rspython project is about: implementing
a python interpreter in rust. Rust already has many features such as vectors,
hashmaps and strings as unicode. There also exist already modules for
regular expressions and dealing with files, so a lot can be re-used in
this area.

During this talk we will dive into rust and python and the design of
the rspython. We will present some challenges and opportunities. Also
we will show the current state of this project in a demo.

[Edinburgh, UK]

By Stephan Jaensch

You've heard about type annotations, you know they help reduce bugs and improve documentation especially for large codebases, and you've attended an introductory talk or read a tutorial about using them. But how do you get started using them with your big, existing codebase? How do you make sure your colleagues will be annotating new code they write - or existing code they're changing? And how do you get around some of the issues you might run into when using the still-beta type checker mypy on your codebase?

This talk will start where the typical introductory Python type annotation talks end and discuss the real-world challenges when starting to annotate types with an existing codebase of tens or hundreds of thousands of lines of code. I'll walk you through best practices learned from doing just that at Yelp, telling you about some of the roadblocks we hit (and how we got past them).

We'll also take a look at:
- how you can get the most out of type annotations even with non-annotated third-party libraries
- how to deal with code patterns that currently don't always work well with annotations
- when the only way to get proper type checking is through refactoring your code.

[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-26 - Kilsyth]
[Edinburgh, UK]

By Mark Shannon

""Taint tracking"" is a technique used in code analysis to find security vulnerabilities and other problems.

Any data that comes from an untrusted source, for example a HTTP request, is treated as ""tainted"".
If that ""tainted"" data is able to reach a vulnerable part of your code, then you have a problem.
Sophisticated code analysis tools can track this data, and reveal potential security problems.
Examples of the sort of problem that can be found include  cross-site scripting (XSS), code injection, SQL injection and others.

In this talk I will show how taint tracking analysis works in practice, introducing the concepts of source, sink and sanitizer.
I will then demonstrate using taint tracking to find a XSS vulnerability in a django app.
(We will chose a project that is designed to teach django security, where the vulnerability is deliberate.)

I will also explain how thinking in terms of ""taint"" can help you write safer code,
even without access to code analysis.

During this talk I will use the code analysis tools on lgtm.com to demonstrate the analysis.
lgtm.com is free to use for open-source projects. A paid version is available.

By Mario Corchero

Ever wonder what mocks, fakes, dummies stubs or spies are? Or what the differences are between them and when one should be used instead of another? We will take a deep look into these concepts, what they mean and examples on how to use/create them in Python.

In this talk, we will quickly explore the reasons for using mock and how it works, quickly jumping into the different concepts of testing doubles and how they can be used in Python. The talk will include as part of the examples from some features in mock coming in Python 3.7 that might change how usual mocking is performed. The talk builds on the writings of Gerard Meszaros and Martin Fowler about testing doubles, focusing on how to apply them to Python.

This session, which will review test isolation concepts and the unittest.mock module, is structured in a way that both beginners and intermediate developers will learn from it. A basic knowledge of testing is recommended. Intermediate developers will leave the room with a clear understanding of the tools - further than just using simple mocks - to successfully fake dependencies. Multiple “not so well known” features of unittest.mock will be presented so we can shape those objects to behave functionally different.
Unittest.mock is an extremely useful library which is commonly underused, this talk aims to bring clarity into stubbing in general and into medium/advanced mock features to ease and remove pain when users work with it.

Outline: 

• Intro (1’)
• Why doubles are important (1’)
• Main qualities of a double (2’)
• Overview of unittest.mock (5')
• Testing doubles (15’)

[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-26 - Kilsyth]

By Ivaylo Donchev

Collecting data from multiple Models is a common flow in Django development. In most of the cases prefetch_related and select_related do all of the job for optimizing the queries.

When the models structure become complicated enough and we've put our logic for collecting these items in models' properties we suddenly cannot use prefetch_related or select_related anymore. Our View 's queries count depends on selected items count with high complexity. The problem is in the selection logic: we've implemented an algorithm which calculates something and we cannot prefetch or select all of the objects. 

So this talk's purpose is: To show how to use Django ORM to move the selection logic, the calculations, the aggregations over group of objects from our python code to our database and moving all of the logic for this in one place - the queryset and test it easily.

In this talk, Bernat will introduce tox, an open source tool with the bold vision of standardizing testing. From a CIs point of view, testing contains much more than just unit and/or integration tests; other things like code style checks, packaging, testing under various versions of Python, and checking that documentation still generates, are just as important. Things quickly start to spiral out of control once you add into the mix that there are many tools and ways to accomplish each of these tasks. In this talk, we will learn how tox tries to abstract away all this complexity, how to easily run CI tests on your local machine, and how one can use this tool inside your CI frameworks to ensure high quality and easily maintainable packages.

This is a presentation of and call for participation in development and testing of Python bindings to Succinct Data Structure Library.

From Wikipedia: Succinct data structures can represent an object (such as a bitvector or a tree) in space close to the information-theoretic lower bound of the object while supporting operations of the original object efficiently. The theoretical time complexity of an operation performed on the classical data structure and the equivalent succinct data structure are (most of the time) identical.

Currently bindings are provided for:


Mutable bit-compressed vectors
Immutable compressed integer vectors
Immutable compressed bit (boolean) vectors
Rank and select operations on bitvectors
Wavelet trees
Comressed suffix arrays


Original library:  https://github.com/simongog/sdsl-lite
Most of examples from SDSL cheat sheet and SDSL tutorial are implemented.

By James Saryerwinnie

Let's face it.  Sometimes our code just isn't working how we expect it to work.
When this happens, we fall back to our trusty tools to help us
debug: pdb, the logging module, or even simple print statements.  But sometimes
that just isn't enough, we still can't figure out why our code is broken.
We need something more.

There are a number of fantastic libraries in python for
creating data visualizations.  These libraries are commonly used for
analyzing and visualizing large sets of data, but don't see as much
usage when it comes to helping us write and debug our code.

What if we could combine the two?  What if we could leverage data
visualization tools to understand what our program is doing?  Sometimes, by
seeing a visual representation of what our code is doing, it becomes much
easier to understand why our code is not working.  We don't need to create
publication quality graphs and charts, we just need to generate quick, one-off
visualizations to understand what our code is doing.  What we want is the ""data
visualization"" equivalent to print() statements.

To help illustrate this point, I will walk through some of the hardest
bugs I've had to track down while working on projects such as the AWS CLI and
boto3, the AWS SDK for Python.  For each bug, I'll show you how I was able to
leverage data visualization techniques to troubleshoot and fix these bugs.
Come learn how to debug more efficiently by leveraging data visualization.

This talk will explore how Long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks combined with Python can use Artificial Intelligence to provide invalid, unexpected, or random data as inputs for testing software and finding network security vulnerabilities. The technique of machine generated test inputs is an established testing approach and is sometimes referred to as fuzzing. I will take this idea further by presenting how various types of machine learning can provide novel outlier test cases to harden software and networks in a way that is superior to using only randomness. Instead, I will discuss how to train neural networks to produce better fuzzing data.This is a natural progression from my work with machine learning and image processing using support vector machines (SVM) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) which I have applied to this new domain of software testing.
This a beginner level talk aimed at all software developers and testers with a goal to giving attendees a basic understanding of fuzz testing.

A retrospective and prospective of Python's adoption in the data-driven industries and how it has and should influence its ecosystem and communities.

Thanks to its versatility, Python's usage and adoption has changed a lot over the last decade to go beyond the very act of software programming.

From Developers to SysOps, closely followed by Scientists and Data analysts, Python has spread to become a common tongue for a wide range of people.

We will start by looking at how this increased adoption impacted Python ecosystem and is still shaping it today. While this talk is not walk through all the Python technologies around data, some of them will be outlined so you will hear words like Numpy, Pandas or Jupyter.

Then we will try to project ourselves in the future and by highlighting the pitfalls Python has to overcome to keep up with its pace and mature in its ability to scale!

Draft of the agenda


The rise and collusion of science and engineering and their influence on Python
From DevOps to DataOps, the shape and breakthroughs of Python's ecosystem
Prospect of challenges and pitfalls in the massive data era

This talk will provide key insights on the learnings I have obtained throughout my career building &amp; deploying machine learning systems in critical environments across several sectors. I will provide a deep dive on how to build scalable and distributed machine learning data pipelines using Airflow with a Celery backend. I will also compare Airflow with other technologies available out there and how it differentiates, such as Luigi, Chronos, Pinball, etc. If you attend the talk, you will obtain an understanding on the solid fundamentals of Airflow, together with its caveats and walk-arounds for more complex use-cases. As we proceed with the examples, I will cover the challenges that you will run into when scaling Machine Learning systems, and how Airflow can be used to address these using a manager-worker-queue architecture for distributed processing with Celery.  By the end of this talk you will have the knowledge required to build your own industry-ready machine learning pipelines to process data at scale, and I will provide further reading resources so people are able to implement the knowledge obtained almost right away.

Sentiment analysis aims at extracting opinions from texts written in natural language, typically reviews or comments on social sites and forums. SpaCy already provides mechanisms for dealing with natural languages in general but does not offer means for sentiment analysis.

This talk gives a short introduction to sentiment analysis in general and shows how to extract topics and ratings by utilizing spaCy's basic tools and extending them with a lexicon based approach and simple Python code to consolidate sentiments spread over multiple words.

Topic covered are:


What is sentiment analysis?
Levels of sentiment detection
Representing opinions
Splitting texts in sentences and words.
Finding the base word (lemma)
Extending spaCy's pipeline and tokens
Matching words to topics and ratings
Combining multiple words to a rating


Code examples are introduced and explained using a Jupyter notebook that can be used as basis for your own analysis.

As additional twist the analyzed texts are not in English but German to show that this approach can be used for multiple languages. No knowledge of German is required though because translations of the short examples sentences are provided.

[Edinburgh, UK]

By Sarah Bird

We all know the internet can be a scary place. In this talk I’ll focus on two ways I’ve found it positively terrifying. First, digging into tracking technologies, I have learned about the breadth and depth of ways our online activity is monitored, stored, and repackaged. Second, when starting out to learn a new skill, the tidal wave of information available online can be overwhelming.

Using the PyData stack to explore and visualize different data sources, including a new dataset from Mozilla, we’ll examine some of the many types of online tracking. My goal is to leave the audience with:

1) A sense of the breadth of tools in the PyData toolbox that can be applied to a real-world analysis
  2) An understanding of a few methods of online tracking so they can be more informed internet citizens

In particular, now that the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has come into force, we can explore the data in light of EU citizens’ new rights, and the new responsibilities of companies worldwide.

Along the way, I’ll also talk about becoming a software engineer, then a builder of data science tools, and my new journey into data science. Being self-taught can be, lonely, scary, and full of embarrassing pitfalls. I’ll share some stories about my learning journey, and the people and resources that have supported me.

[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-26 - PyCharm [PyData]]
[Edinburgh, UK]

By Obiamaka Agbaneje

Machine learning algorithms used in the classification of text are Support Vector Machines, k Nearest Neighbors but the most popular algorithm to implement is Naive Bayes because of its simplicity based on Bayes Theorem.

The Naive Bayes classifier is able to memorise the relationships between the training attributes and the outcome and predicts by multiplying the conditional probabilities of the attributes with the assumption that they are independent of the outcome.  It is popularly used in classifying data sets that have a large number of features that are sparse or nearly independent such as text documents.

In this talk, I will describe how to build a model using the Naive Bayes algorithm with the scikit-learn library using the spam/ham youtube comment dataset from the UCI repository.  Preprocessing techniques such as Text normalisation and Feature extraction will be also be discussed.

By Matthew Honnibal

Commercial machine learning projects are currently like start-ups: many projects fail, but some are extremely successful, justifying the total investment. While some people will tell you to ""embrace failure"", I say failure sucks --- so what can we do to fight it? In this talk, I will discuss how to address some of the most likely causes of failure for new Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects. My main recommendation is to take an iterative approach: don't assume you know what your pipeline should look like, let alone your annotation schemes or model architectures. I will also discuss a few tips for figuring out what's likely to work, along with a few common mistakes. To keep the advice well-grounded, I will refer specifically to our open-source library spaCy, and our commercial annotation tool Prodigy.

By Kamila Stepniowska

Python is very often recommended as the language of choice in a programming education. I can see at least two cases when it's a thing:
- introduction to programming - regardless an age and any previous educational experience,
- data science - it's just a standard...
and actually both - you can teach a future data scientists starting by teaching Python. 

During this talk, I would like to briefly present you what Open Source Python educational materials do we have there and how those are and can be used to teach Python and data science. PyLadies, Django Girls, Django Carrots, Python Software Foundation creates many very available materials. From the data science side, you have Open Source materials created by kaggle, Minerva, Github repos, and many other organizations and individuals. 

During this talk you will learn:
- where to find an Open Source Python and data science tutorials and educational materials
- how does the Python community can support your learning process
- why learning data science with Python is a good idea.

I'm also interested in learning your educational experience with an Open Source materials and Python community supporting your learning experience. If you would like to share a link or your educational story,  please feel free to send me an email on kamila@stepniowski.com. If I will find it interesting for the audience and if you will give me your permission to share it, I might use it in the talk.

By Anna Veronika Dorogush

Gradient boosting is a powerful machine-learning technique that achieves state-of-the-art results
in a variety of practical tasks. For a number of years, it has remained the primary method for
learning problems with heterogeneous features, noisy data, and complex dependencies: web search,
recommendation systems, weather forecasting, and many others.
CatBoost (http://catboost.yandex) is a new open-source gradient boosting library, that outperforms existing publicly available implementations of gradient boosting in terms of quality. It has a set of addional advantages.

CatBoost is able to incorporate categorical features in your data (like music genre, URL, search query, etc.) in predictive models with no additional preprocessing. For more details on our approach please refer to our NIPS 2017 ML Systems Workshop paper (http://learningsys.org/nips17/assets/papers/paper_11.pdf).
CatBoost inference is 20-60 times faster then in other open-source gradient boosting libraries, which makes it possible to use CatBoost for latency-critical tasks.
CatBoost has the fastest GPU and multi GPU training implementations of all the openly available gradient boosting libraries.
CatBoost requires no hyperparameter tunning in order to get a model with good quality.
CatBoost is highly scalable and can be efficiently trained using hundreds of machines


The talk will cover a broad description of gradient boosting and its areas of usage and the differences between CatBoost and other gradient boosting libraries. We will also briefly explain the details of the proprietary algorithm that leads to a boost in quality.

Feature engineering and model training often comes hand in hand. Some tasks have an overwhelming amount of high dimensional data, some tasks have little data or very low-dimension data. 
This talk targets the latter problem: what can be done with the data itself to significantly improve the model performance and when manual feature engineering does make sense. 
A sample case of Classification problem with NN will be presented
The goal of the talk is to remind about something every person working with the data thinks and probably uses.

By Vinicius Pacheco

Creating scalable applications has a number of complex variables and one of them is to work with scalability and performance in the database layer. Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is a design pattern that helps produce more performance and resilience in applications where data access is intense.
In this talk, we will understand when to use and the problems that CQRS solves. We will also apply CQRS in a Python application using the Nameko framework. 

The outline talk is:
        ○ (4 minutes) - Present a real problem of a web application, when creating new instances is not a solution, because the database receives an overwrite of writing and unfeasible to read the data, collapsing the application. 
        ○ (6 minutes) - Present the CQRS pattern conceptually and how this design pattern solves this type of problem using the structure of Command Stack and Query Stack 
        ○ (3 minutes) - Show Nameko as an interesting tool to apply the CQRS. It will demonstrate the use of HTTP, RPC and the possibility of applying pub/sub. 
        ○ (6 minutes) - Create (live code) the Command Stack layer using Nameko on a Postgresql database.
        ○ (5 minutes) - Create (live code) the Query Stack layer using Nameko over a MongoDB database. 
        ○ (3 minutes) - Explain common myths and mistakes about CQRS 
(3 minutes) - Q &amp; A Session

By Marc-Andre Lemburg

Python has gained quite some traction in the web development world and more recently as the goto language for anything that has to do with data science. However, it's use in the enterprise world of applications is rather limited.

Based on the author's many years experience in working in enterprise environments, the talk will demonstrate areas in the business application space where Python has significant advantages over other languages, but which are currently dominated by applications written in Java, C++ or C#.

There are huge opportunities out there for companies to excel at and use the Python advantage to their benefit. If you are looking for a lead idea to kick start your Python business (and you have the resources to invest into marketing), this talk is for you.

[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-26 - Smarkets]
[Edinburgh, UK]

By Roberto Polli

Intro

Italy is introducing a new API Ecosystem because the complexity of the old SOAP-based protocol was now a barrier for the creation of newer services.

This talk presents the Digital Transformation Team  ongoing work on an interoperability framework based on (REST) API, including:


the scheme standardization based on EU standards, ontologies and RFC
an availability strategy based on a distributed circuit-breaker and throttling patterns
a contract-first (API-first) approach to REST services via a href=""https://www.openapis.org/""OpenAPI spec


Challenges


when you can replace SOAP Headers with the HTTP semantics introduced in RFC 7230-7238  
strategies for a non-repudiation system  based on HTTP (eg. DOSETA, JWS, ..)
the path towards an European interoperable API Ecosystem


Prerequisites


basic knowledge of SOAP, REST and the HTTP protocol
general web service issues, DDOS, availability and metrics

By Mika Boström, Alexander Schmolck

Over the past decade, development workflows across industries have converged towards Continuous Integration (CI) with pull requests (PR). Automated testing and artifact generation is useful, but the logic is often flawed: test are run against the source branch, and side effects from successful merges are not accounted for. Marge-bot improves this workflow by allowing to test the PR against the target branch while providing a host of other conveniences.

By Mark Smith

What exactly are functions? Let's talk about functions, methods, callables and closures - what they are, what you can give them, what they can give you, what you can do with them ... and what's inside.

You probably think you already know everything about functions, but you probably don't!

Input &amp; Output: How do you get things in and out of functions? I'll cover parameters and the myriad of ways they can be specified, provided and accessed - including helpful hints to avoid common mistakes! I'll cover return values, briefly, along with variable scopes and exceptions.

Closures: What are they, how do they work and how they can affect memory usage.

Methods: How does a method differ from a function, when are they made, how do they work and how to access the function inside every method.

__magic__:Make your own callables from any object!

Introspection: Using modern Python techniques, what can you find out about a function, and what can you do with that information?

Bytecode: What happens if you open up a function and look at its insides? Can you change it and put it back together again? (Spoiler: Yes, you can.)

By the end of this talk, I guarantee* you'll know more about callables than when you walked in, along with techniques both practical and so extreme your colleagues will never let you merge them to master.

(*This guarantee is legally non-binding and cannot be redeemed in any way.)

The DevOps movement gave us many ways to put Python applications into production. But should your application care? Should it need to know whether it’s running on your notebook, on a server, in a Docker container, or in some cloud platform as a service?

It should not, because environment-agnostic applications are easier to test, easier to deploy, easier to handle, and easier to scale.

But how can you practically structure and configure your applications to make them indifferent to the environment they run in? How do secrets fit into the picture? And where do you put that log file?

By the end of this talk you’ll know the tools and techniques that enable you to write such Python applications and you’ll be ready for the next big change.

It's a great time to be a software developer. Platforms are steadily becoming more mature, useful tools are released almost daily and things that seemed hopelessly futuristic only a few years ago are suddenly commercially viable. Despite this, the software world is awash with bullshit. The success of the largest technology companies has led to a very skewed set of lessons. This narrow focus is amplified by the venture capital industry and the fact that nobody really knows what's going to happen next.

The good news is, none of this actually matters. The basics of creating something useful and selling it for money remain the same. In this talk, I'm not going to give you ""one weird trick"" or tell you to ~* just follow your dreams *~. But I'll share some of the things we've learned from building a successful software company around commercial developer tools and our open-source library spaCy.

Data Science is gonna save the world, right? Or is it? 
Machine Learning epic fails are being largely commented. It's easy to convince ourselves that they are due to the inconsiderate misuse of Data Science. But is it really so? Is it possible that innocuous choices lead an honnest team to a disaster?

During the course of this talk, we will build together an (imaginary) application: a disruptive AI-based smart virtual assistant, pledging to help high-schoolers with their university choice. We will see how unintended biaises may creep in at every step, even with the best of intentions. We will explore different topics, such as algorithmic fairness, model interpretability and the handling of minority classes.

Through this practical example, this talk will present a review of major ethical pitfalls identified in the Machine Learning community along with suggestions on how to avoid them.

This talk is intended for beginner to intermediate Data Scientists, and people working with Data Scientists, even without specific technical knowledge.

By Pietro Mascolo

In Machine Learning and Data Science in general, understanding the data is paramount. This understanding can come from many different sources and techniques: domain expertise, exploratory analysis, SMEs, some specific Machine Learning techniques, and feature engineering.
As a matter of fact, most Machine Learning and Statistical analysis strongly depends on how the data is prepared, thus making feature engineering very important for any serious Machine Learning enterprise.

""Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem to the predictive models, resulting in improved model accuracy on unseen data.""

In this talk we will discuss what feature engineering  and feature selection are; how to select important features in a real-world dataset and how to develop a simple, but powerful ensemble to measure feature importance and perform feature selection.

Familiarity with intermediate concepts of the Python programming language is required to follow the implementation steps. General knowledge of the basic concepts of Machine Learning and data cleaning will be useful, but not strictly necessary, to follow the discussion on feature selection and feature engineering.

Plotly Dash is a Python  framework for building interactive dashboards and web data applications, based on Flask, React.js, and Plotly. It allows a python-only approach to something that previously required knowledge of Javascript, heavily reducing the overhead required to create a web application. I'll show how easy it is to set up a small interactive web app using data from the Twitch API and to expand it at will, using only Python.

Statistics show that eating ice cream causes death by drowning.

If this sounds baffling, this talk will help you to understand correlation, bias, statistical significance and other statistical techniques that are commonly (mis)used to support an argument that leads, by accident or on purpose, to drawing the wrong conclusions.

The casual observer is exposed to the use of statistics and probability in everyday life, but it is extremely easy to fall victim of a statistical fallacy, even for professional users.

The purpose of this talk is to help the audience understand how to recognise and avoid these fallacies, by combining an introduction to statistics with examples of lies and damned lies, in a way that is approachable for beginners. 

Agenda:


Correlation and causation
Simpson's Paradox
Sampling bias
Data visualisation gone wild
Statistical significance (and Data dredging a.k.a. p-hacking)

By Lauris Jullien

Data science and Machine Learning are hot topics right now for Software Engineers and beyond. And there are a lot of python tools that allow you to hack together a notebook to quickly get insight on your data, or train a model to predict, or classify. Or you might have inherited some data wrangling and modeling {Jupyter/Zeppelin} notebook code from someone else, like the resident data scientist. 

The code works on test data, when you run the cells in the right order (skipping cell 22), and you believe that the insight gained from this work would be a valuable game changer. But now how do you take this experimental code into production, and keep it up-to-date with a regular retraining schedule? And what do you need to do after that, to ensure that it remains reliable and brings value in the long term?

These will be the questions this talk will answer, focusing on 2 main themes:
     1. What does running an ML model in production involve?
     2. How to improve your development workflow to make the path to production easier?

This talk will draw examples from real projects at Yelp, like migrating a pandas/sklearn classification project into production with pyspark, while aiming to give advice that is not dependent on specific frameworks, or tools, and is useful for listeners from all backgrounds.

By David Liu

With the increase in computing power, harnessing and controlling one’s code out of the single-threaded realm becomes an ever-increasing problem, coupled with the desire to stay in the Python layer. With the recent tools and frameworks that have been published, escaping the GIL cleanly is much easier than before, allow one’s Python code to effectively utilize multi-core and many core architectures in the most Pythonic ways possible. In this talk, learn about how to utilize static multiprocessing for process pinning, and effectively balancing thread pools with a monkey-patched import of threading modules.

Overview:

Introduction to multithreading and multiprocessing in Python


History of multithreading+multiprocessing in Python, classic frameworks 
Problems that can occur (oversubscription, nested parallelism issues, process hopping, pool resource on shared machines) 
Python accessing bigger hardware over the last few years (28+ cores, etc) 


When to stay in the GIL, and when to escape it 


The advantages and safety of the GIL
Python-level exiting of the GIL; analysis of when to return to single-threaded, and when threading is a deceivingly bad idea
Accountability of frameworks that natively exit the GIL


The new multithreading and multiprocessing libraries and techniques


static multiprocessing module (smp) (and monkey patching of multiprocessing)
thread pool control with command line calls of Python ( python -m tbb -p 8)


Putting it all together


Examples of using static multiprocessing on a large machine to stop oversubscription
Example of pseudo-daemon process on 4-core machine by processor pinning
Thread pool control on a simple NumPy example


Summary - Best practices for using above methods to control multithreading+multiprocessing


What needs to be done in the space (frameworks and things that need to be exposed)
Problems that still exist in the area


Q&amp;A

[Edinburgh, UK]

By Stefan Baerisch

We will have a quick tour of the many ways Python gives us to handle DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, and PDF and automate some boring office tasks.

Many things are more interesting than office file formats like DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, and PDF. Still, while working with office formats does not seem to be the most fun, it is useful. But we can do better than just useful. With the Python and some great libraries, it is possible to have Python do much of the work you would have to do otherwise:


Create and modify PDF files.
Create Powerpoints presentations from scripts.
Create Excel files, from simple tables to charts and reports.
Combine information in Word documents.


In this talk, we will have a look at a usual working day for Bob and Ann, two fictional office works. Both Bob and Ann work office jobs, but while Bob does all of his work by hand, but Ann knows Python. We will look at different tasks that Bob wants to do, such as preparing an Excel report, building a Powerpoint presentation, or rearranging a PDF. Then, we will look how Ann use Python and some exciting libraries to automate these task.

During the talk, we will use Bob and Ann to consider different task related to office file formats. We will then look at the Python libraries that are available. Then, using this library, we will see how an otherwise boring task can be automated. 
The goal of the task is to showcase the libraries to Python offers to work with standard office formats and provide you with a starting point for your own office automation.

After this talk, you will know how to automate at least some of your daily office tasks. You may also be bored because Python is doing so much of your work for you.  If you know basic Python programming, you will be right at home. There will be some use of Pandas,  but it is not required.

[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-27 - Moorfoot]
[Edinburgh, UK]

By Rivo Laks

Increasingly, our apps are used not by humans but by other apps - via their APIs. Thus it is increasingly important that your APIs are well-designed and easy to consume for other developers.

Adding a few API endpoints to your application for internal consumption is easy. Creating APIs that other developers will love to use is a much harder problem.
You'll need to think about solving variety of topics such as versioning, authentication, response structure, documentation and more. There are existing good practices for each of them, but often developers who haven't done a lot of API work aren't familiar with them.

My talk will show how to find reasonable solutions for those problems.
I will talk about importance and intricacies of good documentation and why auto-generating it from your code is useful. I'll show how to make use of familiarity by using standards such as JSON API and show benefits brought by its standardized response structure that makes lives of 3rd-party developers easier.

Authentication will be discussed, including introduction to OAuth2. I'll talk about when OAuth2 is a good choice and when not, as well as dig into some trickier parts of it.
We'll then move on to versioning and how you can change your API without breaking all existing apps.
Finally we'll wrap it all up by looking at some major APIs that are using the same principles.

The composability of fixtures in pytest is an improvement over traditional
xUnit setup/teardown, reducing the incentive to commit testing crimes such as
multi-stage and stepwise tests. This is great out of the box for unit tests,
but I'm going to show how to combine the power of pytest fixtures with Docker
to build high-level integration tests for microservices or other complex
systems with multiple components. I'll then build on that to show how to embed
mock web services written with Flask right into the test code.

With a sample Java application that makes use of some external resources to
offer a data processing service I'll first quick an overview of Pytest, Docker,
and Flask. Then I'll mix some pre-built code with live test coding to
demonstrate how to build high-level system tests which spin up the application
and its dependencies in Docker. I'll then mock one of the external dependencies
using Flask, allowing the test to control and verify interaction between the
system components. Finally I'll show how to wrap the Flask application in a
WSGI middleware that lets the test inspect interaction with the mocked service.

From a learning and development point of view, building your own is better than
re-using someone else's code so I'll show how the support code for these
features is relatively simple and how the audience can build it themselves to
exactly meet their own needs. And I'll do it all with a sense of fun, a joke
or two and maybe a little storytelling.

This time it’ll be different. It’s a green field project and you’ve learned from your mistakes. You’re not going to make the same ones again.

Fast forward several months and you’re in a mess. A change in one place causes bugs in a completely different place. Adding a simple feature means making changes all over your application. Progress is getting slower and slower. You’re lost in complexity.

Why does this keep happening and what can we do about it? 

This talk will try to answer those questions.

I’ll show how complex software really is, define the different types of complexity found in software, explain the issues complexity causes and discuss different techniques we can use to manage it.

This talk is suitable for anyone who has worked or will work on a software development project. No development experience is required.

Materials are available at https://github.com/hchasestevens/europython-2018

This session will introduce attendees to Python's rich ecosystem of abstract syntax tree tooling and libraries, with an emphasis on practical applications in static analysis and metaprogramming. Attendees should be fully comfortable with Python syntax and semantics, but familiarity with the ast module itself will not be necessary. 

The talk will begin with a conceptual overview of ASTs, including a brief look at Python's built-in introspection capabilities. It will introduce tools for AST visualization (astor, showast, python-ast-explorer), creation (asttools, meta), and transformation to source code (codegen). 

How the AST can be used for static analysis will be covered; this will include discussion of Python's built-in facilities (NodeVisitor) as well as of the 3rd party tools astsearch, astpath, and bellybutton. The talk will demonstrate the advantages and limits of these tools in comparison to other static analysis tooling (pylint, mypy); particular attention will be paid to how these tools can be incorporated into attendees' workflows and  existing codebases and projects. 

Tooling for Python AST manipulation and metaprogramming will be the final topic covered, focusing on the use of the NodeTransformer built-in. The talk will cover practical applications and examples of metaprogramming, such as metaprogramming for DSLS (pony, xpyth), runtime code manipulation (patterns, yield-from), and others (e.g. assertion rewriting in pytest).

While the talk will touch only briefly on each of the applications discussed, by the end of the session attendees should have a firm grasp of the kinds of problems the AST can be used to solve, what existing AST tooling can accomplish, and what resources are available for the development of their own AST tools.

This talk will briefly go over the various decorator syntaxes before breaking up the common usages of decorators into 5 categories. Effectively, these are design patterns for decorators. The usages to be considered are:


A - Argument Changing Decorators -- Decorators that change a function's arguments, including changing its signature
B - Binding Decorators -- Decorators that implement the Descriptor Protocol, such as the builtins: @property, @classmethod, and @staticmethod
C - Control Flow Decorators -- Decorators that change when or whether the function will be called, such as @retry or @lrucache
D - Descriptive Decorators -- Decorators that do not change the function, but create a reference to it elsewhere, like pytest.mark and flask.app.route
E - Execution Decorators -- Decorators that retrieve source code and/or AST and alter it.

Draft of the talk:


Growing populary of the Python programming language


Defacto language in the scientific world, replacing other closed
source and more specialized but limited language
Favorite programming language used as the first language to learn
programming

Port Python 2 code to Python 3


Port Python 2 code to Python 3
No: ""Add support for Python 3"", don't loose Python 2 support
Port Python 3 code to Python 2
Python changes to make the transition smoother:
PEP 414: u""syntax"" reintroduced in Python 3.3
PEP 461: bytes % args, Python 3.5
More ""Py3k"" warnings added to Python 2.7.x
Linters like flake8 detect some issues
six, futures, modernize, 2to6, etc.

Analysis of the transition


Good: At Pycon US 2014, Guido van Rossum announced that the Python
2.7 support was extended from 2015 to 2020 to give more time to
companies to port their applications to Python 3.
Bad: 2to3: ""drop Python2 support at once"", don't work when you have
dependencies.
If done again, would it be different? Yes, obviously.
Python 4 will be different than Python 3: no more ""break the world""
release, but a ""regular deprecation period"" release, as any other
release. Break things, one by one :-)

Bugs that won't be fixed in Python 2 anymore


Some bugs cannot be fixed without breaking the backward
compatibility
Unicode Support
Python 2 I/O stack bugs: rely on libc stdio.h
Security: hash DoS, enabled by default in Python 3.3, Python 3.4 now
uses SipHash
subprocess is not thread-safe in Python 2.
Python 2 subprocess has many race conditions: fixed in Python 3
with a C implementation which has less or no race condition.
Handling signals while forking in complex.
threading.RLock is not ""signal safe"" in Python 2
Python 2 requires polling to wait for a lock or for I/O.
Python 3 uses native threading API with timeout and has asyncio.
Python 3 uses a monotonic clock to not crash on system clock update
(ex: DST change).
Python 3 has a better GIL.
Python 2 inherits file descriptors on fork+exec by default.
Python 3 don't: PEP 446.
Functions can fail with OSError(EINTR) when interrupted by a signal,
need to be very careful everywhere. SIGCHLD when a child process
completes, SIGWINCH when using ncurses. Python 3.5 restarts the
interrupted system call for you.

Performance


Python 3.6 is now faster than Python 2.7
https://speed.python.org/

Evolutions of the Python language


Python 3.5
PEP 492: async/await ""keywords"" for asyncio.
(Really keywords in Python 3.7.)
PEP 461: bytes % args and bytearray % args
PEP 465, a new matrix multiplication operator: a @ b.
PEP 448: Generalized unpacking:
head, *tail = list
mylist = [1, 2, **other_list]
mydict = {""key"": ""value"", **other_dict}
Python 3.6
PEP 515: million = 1_000_000
name = ""World""; print(f""Hello {name}!"") 
 PEP 526, syntax for variable annotations.
PEP 525, asynchronous generators.

By Sven-Hendrik Haase

Rust is a safe and modern systems programming language that is easily able to call and be called from Python. As such, it is a prime candidate for replacing C for writing Python modules that have to be fast or that have to interact with other native code. Rust is extremely fast and makes it very hard to get concurrency wrong.

Many ways of making Python call into lower level have appeared over the years such as CFFI, ctypes, boost.python, cython, SWIG. All of them are cumbersome in their own ways. PyO3 is a Rust library that makes it easy and simple to write native Python modules with minimal glue code and no crazy tooling required. It even works cross-platform without problems.

The talk shows some sample code of PyO3-based modules and compares it with the code of the alternatives as well as the alternative's cross-platform support and tooling.

The goal is for the audience to be informed about a new safe and modern way of writing native Python modules.

The audience doesn't need any prerequisites except for a healthy interest in native code and Python modules. C knowledge is optional.

Anyone who has ever conducted an elementary programming course, or even answered a question on StackOverflow, will know that reading error messages is a skill that beginners have to learn. 
It is less widely appreciated that writing good error messages is also a skill that must be learnt.
This talk is in two parts. 
The first covers the commonest error message gaffes:
•   Insufficiently explicit messages.
•   Issuing the same message for two different conditions.
•   Suppressing the stack trace.
•   Polluting the stack trace.
The second part describes a way to ensure usable, actionable error messages, even when the writer of the message is not a professional coder. This was developed for an environment where superusers code up most of the dozens of data validation rules and the accompanying messages, and the application in which Python is embedded suppresses the stack trace.

By Emmanuelle Delescolle

A couple years ago I was approached by a client to help them improve the performance and maintainability of their code.

That code was filled with very long functions, some of them with very similar code and the project was really hard to understand as a whole.

My first reflex was to refactor this code code to make it more understandable. In my opinion, it did fit part of my assignment as understandable code is easier to maintain but it was also very helpful later in letting me make small changes with full knowledge of what was going to be affected by those changes.

Large methods and functions is something that creeps into our code whether we plan for it or not. This talk is about one way to deal with it.

This talk will be based on code provided by the GildedRose Refcatoring Kata: https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata

Prerequisites:
- Basic knowledge of Python
- Basic knowledge of OOP

Goals:
- Demonstrate one approach for refactoring code
- Show how to leverage Python's dynamic nature to make code simpler

By Ben Nuttall

A look at the GPIO Zero library for Raspberry Pi yields the blueprint for a Pythonic API for programming the behaviour of interconnected devices.

GPIO Zero provides a multi-paradigm programming interface to GPIO devices:
- procedural (polling)
- procedural (blocking)
- event-driven (callbacks)
- declarative

Start with simple scripts to control LEDs and buttons on a breadboard, learn to prototype ideas and move on to declaring interaction between more advanced devices in the home and beyond.

These options for device programming, along with the extensibility of the library, provide the means to program complex behaviour using simple Pythonic code.

GraphQL query language is gaining popularity and seeing more adoption.
This is mainly due to the efficiency with which consumers can get their data, the ease with which you can document and explore your API and the powerful tooling that has been built around the query language.

This talk is for novices and experts of GraphQL alike and aims to cover the basics of the query language, how to implement it using Flask and SQLAlchemy and to take a deeper dive into how Python’s type-hinting can be used to generate your GraphQL schema. 

I’ll also be talking about some of the tooling that can be used to provide consumers and developers working on your API with a great development experience. Next I'll cover some ways you can use these tools to empower your development process and get you developing 'API First'. 

To get the most out of this talk you should have a general understanding of APIs, Python frameworks and Python ORMs. However, my aim is to make it as accessible as possible for developers of all experience levels.

[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-27 - Kilsyth]

By Robert Smallshire

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is an approach to software development that emphasises high-fidelity modelling of the problem domain, and which uses a software implementation of the domain model as a foundation for system design. This approach helps organize and minimize the essential complexity of your software.  DDD has been used with success within the traditional enterprise programming ecosystems of Java and .NET, but has seen only limited adoption in the Python community.

In this talk we introduce Python programmers to the core tactical patterns of DDD and show how they can be realised in idiomatic Python, freeing the most valuable parts of your system – the domain model – from onerous dependencies on particular databases or application frameworks.

In this talk we share what we've learned from applying DDD in Python to large projects.

By Raphael Pierzina

In this talk, I will give an insight into what it means to maintain a popular project for me personally, what it involves and what we as a community can do to help out and finally why I think it's an important discussion to have.

Cookiecutter is a command-line utility that creates projects from templates. It is free and open-source software distributed under the terms of a permissive BSD-3 license. With around 180 individual contributors, more than 1000 public templates on GitHub alone, and multiple talks at conferences, it is fair to say that there is a small community around it.

But who are the people behind the project and what is it that they are doing?

It's been three years since I was granted the commit bit by the core team. I have learned a lot about FOSS communities and also about myself. At times I struggle with balancing my day job as a full-time Software Engineer and maintaining Cookiecutter and other FOSS projects in my spare time. By now I'm OK with not responding to issues immediately and closing pull requests. However it took me quite a while to get to this point.

Maintaining FOSS projects can be incredibly rewarding and fun, but it can also be quite frustrating. It involves so much more than writing code or merging PRs, and yet sometimes it feels like that's what most people think. The goal of this talk is to start a conversation around this topic and hear what other EuroPython attendees think about it and their challenges as contributors or maintainers.

By Alex Grönholm

Maintaining an open source project can be a drag. Especially when you have dozens of them. Besides being tedious , making a new release can be a very error prone process. Maybe you forgot to run the full test suite, forgot to update the release version or tag the release on VCS or maybe you bungled up the upload to PyPI. Fortunately there are things you can do to eliminate entire categories of human errors in the release process – by automating them.

This talk uses a trivial project as an example to present a release pipeline, from packaging and testing to deployment, that only requires you to push a git tag to your Github repository. Automation then takes care of the rest and you end up with a new release on PyPI (yay!).

This talk is mostly useful for open source developers using Github to house their projects, as it heavily leans on Travis, its continuous integration provider . You also need to be at least somewhat familiar with Python packaging and testing in order to follow along. Familiarity with common tools like pytest and tox helps but is not strictly required.

Vincent was playing a card game against his girlfriend and he kept loosing. So he wanted to train a bot to play on his behalf. This is our story.

We’re using AWS Lambda to get better at a card game named SushiGO. We make a small genetic algorithm in Python that uses AWS Lambda as a backend. The talk consists of these parts:


Quick Explanation of the rules of the SushiGo Card Game
Translation of real life to an algorithm
Explain why this problem needs a lot of CPU
Explain why AWS Lambda fits the simulation use-case 
How to quickly hack Concurrency in Python
How to deploy lambda very quickly with chalice 
Experimentation Results 


This talk will discuss an algorithm that we’ve tried to improve in three ways:


Applying simple maths to make the search algorithm better
Throwing lots (lots!) of CPU’s against the problem by leveraging AWS Lambda and python concurrency


We will conclude by discussing whether or not AWS Lambda is suitable for a gridsearch/grid simulation (hint, it’s not meant for this task, but it actually kind of works very well).

Math is a crucial skill for people who are interested in Data Science and Machine Learning. Until now, most of the people who are doing Data Science have a strong background in math, usually, people with master or Ph.D. degrees. 

However, this fact seems to change in the next years, after the hype of Machine Learning we are facing a process of democratization. Now the door of Data Science is open for everyone.

To truly madly deeply understand how the machine learning algorithms work we need to understand some mathematical concepts. In this tutorial, I would like to share my experience in the process of learning some of those concepts. 

What I want to do is build a bridge between those concepts and Python, more specifically, SciPy and NumPy and TensorFlow.  Basically is just another tutorial about vectorization, in this case, oriented to understand and implement machine learning algorithms and the mathematical foundation that supports it.

Outline


Review of linear algebra: A brief review of essential linear algebra, concepts and the explanation with NumPy: scalars, vectors, matrices, tensors, multiplication of vectors, inner products, vector spaces, etc.
Review of machine learning: A brief review of essential machine learning, concepts that are related to mathematical concepts: dimensionality reduction, principal component analysis, etc.
Optimization: Analytical vs. numerical solutions. This part has too many formulas, well, not too many.
Vectorization: Numpy and TensorFlow.
Small practical cases: 

I want to show how we can solve the XOR problem with only one neuron 
Explain the math behind recurrent neural networks.

By Marcel Raas

This talk is about applying deep learning to music. We will look at the raw music data and discover the following:


How to detect instruments from a piece of music
How to detect what is being played by what instrument
How to isolate instruments in multi-instrument (polyphonic) music


Instead of applying it to existing music we will generate our own music using some simple musical rules. The benefit of this is that we are in control of the complexity and we know exactly what is being played. We start out simple and then start adding more instruments, different timbres, etc. As we go up in complexity, we shall see how to adapt our models to be able to deal with it. This gives interesting insights in what structures in deep nets work well.

I will show:


How to build a simple synthesizer using numpy
How to create an unlimited data set of improvisation that sounds musical
How to use this data set for detecting instruments using deep learning
How to filter out one instrument when multiple synthesizers are playing at once

Deep Learning is all the rage, but ensemble models are still in the game. With libraries such as the recent and performant LightGBM, the Kaggle superstar XGboost or the classic Random Forest from scikit-learn, ensembles models are a must-have in a data scientist’s toolbox. They’ve been proven to provide good performance on a wide range of problems, and are usually simpler to tune and interpret. This talk focuses on two of the most popular tree-based ensemble models. You will learn about Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, relying respectively on bagging and boosting. This talk will attempt to  build a bridge between the theory of ensemble models and their implementation in Python.

[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-27 - Fintry [PyData]]
[Edinburgh, UK]

By Douglas Finch

Poor surface air quality has a range of implications for human health and the economy. Without concerted mitigation efforts, trends in urbanisation and aspirations for progressive economic growth will result in poorer levels of air quality. Analysing and interpreting the incoming data streams from heterogeneous air quality measurement stations is critical for tackling the problem and for developing early warning systems. I am using Python to develop a set of online analysis tools (ukatmos.org) to enable the public to quickly and easily plot air quality data in many ways, effectively freeing up information that is already publicly available but in awkward formats and often involves development of code. We anticipate these tools will also support data science classes at school, and can speed up scientific research by minimizing effort in repeating analyses. 

This talk will cover how the tools integrate numerous Python libraries (e.g. Pandas and NumPy), the Django web framework, the Plot.ly tools for creating interactive graphs, and SQL to address the large data volumes. Developing these Python tools in an adaptive and scalable way allows it to grow as more data become available, e.g. satellite observations. Adaptability also includes evolving user requirements. This project will also be developed into a Python library allowing the user to easily use the online analysis tools from an offline Python environment.

Flask is a great web mirco-framework, that is best utilised with
event-loop concurrency. Sadly with Flask the event-loop framework
can't be asyncio, although some extensions (Flask-Aiohttp) have
tried. Quart is the solution as it shares the Flask API and is
based on asyncio. In addition Quart goes beyond Flask adding
HTTP/2 and websockets.

This talk will outline why event-loop concurrency is a good
choice for web servers, why asyncio is a good choice and then
give an overview of Quart, demonstrating features that go beyond
the Flask framework.

In this talk 14 year old Josh will introduce you to his project called EduBlocks, which is a drag and drop version of Python 3 that he has created to help teachers introduce programming languages, like Python, to children at an earlier age.
The goal of the project is to make the transition from block based programs like Scratch to Python easier for students and teachers, as presently there is no drop-in solution that bridges this gap. Josh will share his journey so far with you, from how he came up with the idea when he was only 11 years old, the developments along the way, the exciting plans for the future and how schools today in over 72 different countries  around the world are making use of EduBlocks on the Raspberry Pi and micro:bit.

[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-27 - Smarkets]
[Edinburgh, UK]

By Jeethu Rao

The cPython’s startup speed generally quite fast compared to other similar dynamic language interpreters. Despite this, the interpreter’s startup time increases linearly with the number and size of imported python modules. Although interpreter startup speed isn't a significant concern in long running servers, it does matter for the command line and other frequently launched applications.

One of the oldest tricks in the book, when it comes to performance optimizations is to perform frequent and expensive operations fewer times and reuse results from previous invocations. We noticed that the overhead of reading and un-marshalling .pyc files at startup can be eliminated if we could directly embed code objects and their associated object graph from .pyc files into the data segment of the cPython binary. This technique is quite similar to the approach taken by image based languages like Smalltalk in the past. Implementing this for cPython is made simpler because marshaled code objects in .pyc files contain a subset of the types of objects that marshal format supports. With this approach, loading a module included in the python binary is as cheap as dereferencing a pointer, albeit at the cost of increased binary size.

This talk will discuss the approach taken to implement the aforementioned idea for Python 3.6 and the challenges faced in implementing it. It will also talk about benchmark results from the improvements and possible future directions for this work. Although this talk delves into cPython internals, no prior experience with cPython internals is required to follow along.

By Alexandre Figura

You are maybe like me: I never learned at school how to write tests. My teachers gave me at first a broad overview of computer history. Then, they explained me some basic design patterns. And to finish, I often had to write more or less basic programs, to validate and demonstrate my skills. Not the kind of code I would be really proud of today: the procrastinator monkey living in my head at this time was more thinking about planning my summer holidays, rather than writing Ninja code!

And to make things worse, my studies focused on network and system engineering. Not software architecture. Funny story, because I decided to become programmer a couple of years later...

What I realize now is that I don't have as much time as before to learn. And in a world driven by business, where time is money, and where tradeoffs are the rule, there is rarely enough money to write both shiny new features and a complete test suite.

People who practice Test-Driven Development know how complicated it can be to write proper tests. TDD is often discouraging at first: the learning curve is steep. But this problem also exists in the testing world in general. Because writing good tests is hard, many beginners get headaches trying to reach this goal. How to convince project managers to have more time for writing tests in these conditions...

But ""le jeu en vaut la chandelle"" as we say in French (""the juice is worth the squeeze""). Well tested applications are not only easier to maintain and extend. They also have in general a better API. That's what we will see in this talk, by focusing on how to write integration tests. Our journey will begin with a presentation of different testing strategies. We will then jump to the practical part, using Pytest, interface testing , dependency injections and stubs, amongst many others. And because we want to add nice buzzwords on our resume after EuroPython, we will finish this talk by automating the whole with Docker Compose.

By Alex Willmer

Pickle is a compact serialisation protocol for Python objects.  It could be a convenient way for Python programs and distributed systems to communicate. Unfortunately pickle is widely considered to be unsafe, and it has lead to several vulnerabilities over the years. As the Python manual warns


  The pickle module is not secure against erroneous or maliciously 
  constructed data. Never unpickle data received from an untrusted
  or unauthenticated source.


Does this have to be the case? Can we use Pickle safely?

This talk will be a deep dive into what an attacker can do with a maliciously constructed pickles. I’ll show what defences you can implement against the common attacks, especially those that gain arbitrary code execution. I will present new research into other attacks, and mitigations. Finally I will review a few less known alternatives to pickle.

Celery is a distributed task queue for Python. Although it is most popular in the web development ecosystem, it has a wide area of usage from system management to IoT devices. With Celery, transforming a function into a task is quite easy and can add great performance &amp; usability to the applications that we build.

This talk aims to give attendants a general overview on Celery and its uses. We will walk through the core Celery architecture by introducing key components with the help of various real-world examples. This will also lead to an understanding of the task queue systems in general. Attendants will also gain knowledge about Celerybeat; a tool that focuses on scheduling tasks.

We will be looking for the answers to the following questions:

What is a distributed task queue?
What are the main elements of Celery?
When should we use Celery tasks?
How do we use Celery Beat?

Attendants should have a basic knowledge of Python, and a minor development experience.

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-10 - Arengo]
[Rimini, Italy]

Last year's talk (https://ep2016.europython.eu/conference/talks/writing-unit-tests-for-c-code-in-python) showed you how to use CFFI (https://cffi.readthedocs.io/) to write unit tests for C code in Python. This year we will take the concept one step further and create integration tests covering (almost) the whole firmware of a microcontroller, again leveraging the power of CFFI.

But instead of running the firmware on the controller, it will be executed on the development machine (that is, a standard x86 architecture), allowing for much faster test execution, without requiring the target hardware. For this to work, all the hardware-dependent parts of the firmware code need to be replaced by Python code simulating the hardware functionality, so that all the firmware above this hardware abstraction layer can be executed unmodified.

In addition, this allows to use advanced security testing tools like AddressSanitizer (https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer) and american fuzzy lop (http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/) that would not be able to run directly on the microcontroller.

Debugging is a daily activity of any programmer. Frequently, it is assumed that programmers can debug. However, programmers often have to deal with existing code that simply does not work. This tutorial attempts to change that by introducing concepts for debugging and corresponding programming techniques.

In this tutorial, participants will learn strategies for systematically debugging Python programs. We will work through a series of examples, each with a different kind of bug and with increasing difficulty. The training will be interactive, combining one-person and group activities, to improve your debugging skills in an entertaining way.

Syntax Error against Runtime exceptions
Get file and directory names right
Debugging with the scientific method
Inspection of variables with print and introspection functions
Using an interactive debugger
Pros and cons of try.. except

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-10 - PyCharm Room]
[Rimini, Italy]

Python is an interpreted development language with powerful introspection features, up to allow accesso to the byte code itself to see what the virtual machine is going to do. Reaching down to byte code or low level inspection is usually a very uncommon need and it's usually only involved in debugging or understanding the interpreter internals, but it can be a powerful tool to check that third parties code that (or the code we will write ourselves in the future) sticks to some protocols or best practices that are supposed to be in place.

Most of the needs for this checks are usually performed at execution time or through techniques like metaclasses and monkeypatching of third parties code, but in some cases it would be possible to inadvertently skip those checks or work them around, while verifying the resulting byte code allows us to check what's really going to be executed and enforce the required constraints.

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-10 - Anfiteatro 1]
[Rimini, Italy]

Why should a Python programmer be interested in Bitcoin and the Blockchain technology?

Blockchain technology is one of the fastest moving part in the Fintech area. However, the Blockchain is not only the basis of crypto currencies. First of all it’s a decentralized registry that cannot be modified. This means that using a Blockchain, users can trust in the validity of a dataset without the need to establish a central authority. Thus, the Blockchain can be used to store records e.g. of land ownership or and other property rights in countries with weak or corrupt or otherwise incompetent authorities.

Therefore, Python programmers with an understanding of this technology are especially well prepared to contribute in this area, because the agility inherent to Python makes it easy to program in a fast moving environment. The fact that various applications in the Bitcoin and Blockchain area are implemented in Python prove this notion. However, the reverse is also true: An understanding of the distributed ledger technology possibly enables you to solve problems in projects you encounter in the near future.

In this talk, I will present the following topics:
•   The Blockchain architecture: nodes, transactions, headers.
•   The Bitcoin protocol and its proof of work (POW)
•   Smart contracts
•   Bitcoin alternatives: Proof-of-work (PoW) compared to Proof-of-stake (PoS)

We will start with a Sanic overview and compare it with other similar options before looking at the API and working through a basic app. Our goal here will be to get a feel for the Sanic API and demonstrate how it fits together. After this we will cover some of the more unique and interesting possibilities with Sanic, such as support for websockets and HTTP2.

A web framework is often only as powerful as its ecosystem, so we will take a look at some of the popular Sanic extensions for databases, templating and testing.

Rapid Application Development has been a major topic for the desktop development world. Yet, desktop development has proven to be at the end of its timeline and the latest major environment is now the web in its many forms (from browser to Electron and similars). Django offers an amazing infrastructure and Django Rest Framework an amazing middleware to solve most of the problems. The RAD development on Angular2 is then enabled by a set of libraries developed at Modal Nodes for both front and backend that ease the development of the front end tools and front end interactions with both unauthenticated and authenticated systems via JWT and Djoser. Specifically, we will see the changes in the metadata that will enable better interactions and the usage of both the backend elements and the front-end ones in order to ease development.

Python has grown in both significance and popularity in the last years, especially in the field of high performance computing and machine learning. When it comes to performance, there are numerous ways of profiling and measuring code performance—with each analysis tool having its own strengths and weaknesses. In this talk, we will introduce a rich GUI application (Intel® VTune™ Amplifier) which can be used to analyze the runtime performance of one’s Python application, and fully understand where the performance bottlenecks are in one’s code.  With this application, one may also analyze the call-stacks and get quick visual clues where one’s Python application is spending time or wasting CPU cycles.

Logs are your best friends on those late nights when you try to troubleshoot that problem in production that was written by a friend of you who is on holidays at the moment. Logs are the main way to know what is happening at runtime with an running application but as we don’t realize how important they are until we actually need them it is usually an under appreciated part of our development process.

This talks overviews the logging module of the standard library and demonstrates some basic best practices and techniques make the most out of our logging when we need it.

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-10 - Arengo]
[Rimini, Italy]

While demonstrating the pyboard to a group of colleagues, a challenge was set to produce a practical demonstration of the device that would provide automatic and continuous voice recording and playback of short spoken phrases similar to that found in a number of talking toys.

This talk covers the process of designing and testing the embedded real-time Python solution and includes the architecture, test methodologies and recordings as the stages progressed to the final source code. The talk concludes with a live demonstration of the final application. The solution uses MicroPython (an embedded implementation of Python 3), the pyboard and its AMP Audio skin.

MicroPython is a lean implementation of Python 3 that is optimised to run in a very small footprint on micro-controllers and in constrained environments. It was created by the Australian programmer and physicist Damien George, after a successful Kickstarter backed campaign in 2013.

The pyboard is the original reference hardware created to host MicroPython. It is a compact low-power board based on an ARM processor with a heap of approximately 100kBytes that can run at 168MHz. It has sufficient hardware services and real-time capabilities to control all kinds of electronic projects.

The AMP Audio skin is a small additional module that attaches to the pyboard that adds a small power amplifier, speaker and a microphone with a pre-amp.

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-10 - Arengo]
[Rimini, Italy]

Compiling source code into libraries and executables has always been problematic, especially for cross platform projects. Typical problems in existing build systems include slow build times, undecipherable syntax, lack of support for cross compilation and so on. Some people choose to not use a build system at all but instead just write a one-off Makefile, which will usually work fine on their machine and nowhere else. All this makes software development slower than it needs to be.

The Meson build system (http://mesonbuild.com) is a new build system designed from the ground up to provide a solution for these (and other) problems. It is implemented in Python 3 and provides a simple, non-Turing complete DSL for describing the build. The project provides built-in support for common tasks such as documentation generation, building Qt apps and Python extension modules. Meson is currently seeing a lot of uptake in the Free software world with big projects such as GStreamer, parts of GNOME, Wayland and even the X server either transitioning, or very strongly considering the transition to Meson. 

In this talk we go over the design of Meson, how to use it for new and existing projects and the benefits this brings, including faster compiles, less time wasted debugging the build system environment and easy access to modern software development tools and practices.

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-10 - Arengo]
[Rimini, Italy]

The main goal of this presentation is to make beginner audience familiar with mocks and patches but there is a chance that more experienced ones will also find something new for themselves. Presentation shows the common use cases when developing unit tests. I will say what are the best practices when working with mocks and patches and what kind of mistakes, done by many developers, may be avoided so the dragons will not come. During this presentation I will prepare mock-it-o drink as a prize.

First, I will briefly introduce an audience with the topic of unit testing. Then I will show a simple code which will be tested during the presentation. It covers all common use cases of writing unit tests which are usage of mocks, patches and their side effects. In the end I will show a template of unit test which will be extended according to our needs.

Next, I will say what is a mock, and what are the benefits of using it. Why it is better than any Dummy class implemented for purpose of unit tests and, what is the most important and sometimes forgotten by experienced developers, how to create the best mock, which involves using spec_set and spec to protect us from dragons when interface of mocked class changes.

Last but not least part of my presentation will be dedicated to patches. I will explain when and how patches should be used (how to use side_effect, patch properties and environment variables). Finally, I will say how to avoid common mistakes when working with patches.

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-10 - PyCharm Room]
[Rimini, Italy]

Web-developers use Python to develop web-applications, serving HTML or JSON content to user's browsers which render it. We test our applications to check that they serve content right and that they respond to HTTP requests in an expected way. However, this is not all that happens in a modern web application. There are lots of moving parts which are executed not on the server, but directly in user's browser, and they need to be tested too. The best way to check that our app works well in a browser is to test it in a browser, and Python gives you tools to do that conveniently.

With a Selenium tool and Python package, you can control the browsers, making them open web pages and interacting with them. I will show how to install Selenium and needed drivers, and tell about best practices for writing Selenium tests, such as


Page Object pattern
Put browser interactions in the page object, not the test
Put assertions in the test, not the page object
Never use time.sleep()
Always make pages wait for actions to complete
Wait for JavaScript to load


To test the visual look of your application there is a Needle tool, which lets you compare screenshots with baseline set, and highlight the differences. I will talk about how to incorporate that functionality into your tests.

As browser testing can get quite slow, I will also show how to set up running them concurrently.

[Rimini, Italy]

Coala (https://coala.io/) began as a fun project. We never believed there would be anything useful growing out of it - and yet it did. Contributors all over the world came to us and helped creating the community as it is.

But how did all of this happen? What does this mean for the main contributors? How can we make a living of an open source project?

This talk tells our story. What we did - good and bad things - so we can learn from it. From my personal open source contributions over founding an open source project to building a freelance agency and founding a startup.

Participants will learn how they can grow an open source project, automate newcomer processes and gain insights into how they can start making a living of it, possibly founding a company eventually. There is no single recipe for this but we can - and should - exchange the tips and tricks we’ve gained with our ventures. This talk is for entrepreneurs, wanna-be-freelancers and future or past open source project founders.

This talk is completely new and has not been presented at any conference yet although it overlaps with previous talks of mine which have received much positive feedback at previous regional PyCons. It will be tested at a local meetup to ensure proper timing.

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-10 - Anfiteatro 2]
[Rimini, Italy]

One year ago we started OnTruck. Our CTO had previously had some success with DRF so after discussing it, we decided to give it a try. After a year building a quickly iterating startup on top of Django Rest Framework, we have reflected a lot on it. Even now, with a full year of development on top of it, we still periodically discuss going forward or dropping it. For the time being it still wins. So we think we have learned a lot about it.
This talk is a walkthrough of the discoveries &amp; learnings we have made at OnTruck during that year.
We will cover different aspects of the framework, what advantages it has given us and also what tradeoffs it has forced. We will discuss both how it relates to Django on the inside and how it relates with other systems outside. We will approach it both from a purely user perspective and also discuss some of its internals and the way we tweaked them to make it work for us. We will cover the pitfalls we have both avoided and fallen into. The tricks that have helped us keep our speed and sanity. The tools we have both used and discarded on the way. And finally the tips we would give ourselves if we were starting all over again after this year.

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-10 - PyCharm Room]
[Rimini, Italy]

A few weeks into your tenure as a software engineer at the Ministry of Truth you are assigned your first real feature request: write a context manager that can make “2 + 2” equal 5 at runtime. Your solution should be written only in Python (for maximum portability). Absurd? Perhaps, but you know better than to ask questions. You are no thought-criminal.

In this talk I walk through the steps I took to modify the value of two plus two in CPython at runtime—using only Python and the ctypes module. What began for me as a silly and frivolous side project became an education in how the python data model works behind the scenes and how CPython compiles, optimizes, and executes python code.

The goal of this talk is to provide an introduction to CPython internals while walking through the steps needed to monkeypatch integer addition to make “2 + 2” equal 5. The audience should come away with a better understanding of how python objects and types are represented in memory, how references are counted, and how python scripts are transformed into abstract syntax trees, compiled into code objects, and then executed by the CPython virtual stack machine. And because I’ve limited myself to using ctypes, these topics can be explored without familiarity with C as a prerequisite.

The project has joined the Software Freedom Conservancy project and it growing community makes it hopes to become a real alternative to Unity&amp;GameMaker.

This talk cover a year long journey of the port of Python as a scripting language for the engine, starting from a rant against Godot's Python-like proprietary language.

We will have a look at Godot's internal architecture as  is it itself a real interpreter with it garbage collector, dynamic typing, introspection and even builtin custom scripting language. All of this having to work next to our Python interpreter and communicate back and forth with it.

Finally we will see the different approaches that have been tried to bind Python to Godot each with there own pros&amp;cons:


Using Micropython interpreter instead of CPython
Using PyBind11 to statically bind to Godot C++ API
Using CFFI and rely on a 3rd party C API

The audience should have some basic knowledge of C level computing (static vs dynamic language, compilation &amp; linking).

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-10 - PythonAnywhere Room]
[Rimini, Italy]

The role of automated testing at the heart of modern development and operations is a given. However, the traditional approach to testing, separating too-developer-focused unit testing and (often only semi-automated) end-to-end integration testing—is not optimal in the modern, fluid world of DevOps.

Nothing short of full automation is suitable for continuous integration; any “testing” requiring humans has a drastically different place in the continuum of development and deployment and should best be called by a completely different name like quality assurance. Within the realm of fully automated testing, the best approach, just as for other kinds of software, is modular and layered.

This talk highlights the proper design of components for testing purposes and explains how such a design lets you compose multiple, layered testing suites that span the gamut from fast, light-weight unit tests meant to run all the time during development, to full-fledged end-to-end tests of whole systems—and, crucially, the often-neglected intermediate layers, bridging the thoroughness of end-to-end tests with unit tests’ speed and ability to pinpoint the location of any problems that emerge, enabling rapid fixes of most such problems.

The talk also discusses the use of modular, layered testing components to validate software refactoring, and (when deployed in a load-testing arrangement) identify and validate software (and architectural) optimizations.

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-10 - Arengo]
[Rimini, Italy]

If your code calls a third party service then you may want to test that your code works but you don't want to call the service in your tests.

It may be expensive, slow or impossible to call that service. For example, if you are making a Slack bot, you want to create tests which don't make calls across the network to Slack.

One approach is to create a mock of that service. Our tests can now run quickly, cheaply and reliably. But if we copy the service incorrectly, or if the service changes, our tests will pass while our code does not work.

Verified fakes solve this problem. You can write tests which confirm that your mock is an accurate representation of the service being mocked. Those tests can be a small subset of your test suite and they can be run periodically, to verify the validity of the many tests which use the mock.

This talk will follow the example of VWS-Python, a verified fake for a proprietary web service. It will discuss the practicalities of creating such a fake and it will focus on the trade-offs, tooling and approaches involved.

By the end of this talk the audience will understand how to tie together pytest, Travis CI, requests and Responses to create a verified fake.

The talk is aimed at people who have an interest in writing correct software. It is assumed that the audience is familiar with basic testing techniques.

Historically, Python packaging has been a source of significant pain for even the most devoted Python enthusiasts. I've found myself in the situation, where I did know the basic concepts behind the tools, but despite that only thing I could do was following tutorials. That was the time to change it and that's the reason this presentation was written.

In this talk, I'll provide a quick overview of the current state of Python packaging tools. I'll mostly focus on setuptools, pip and wheels, putting an emphasis on their superiority over their precursors. I'll also list down the honorable mentions of tools worth knowing. Then I'll share examples of how you can use the features of the Setuptools library - those well known and those we use when pip-installing packages, but most of us can't name them.

The point of this presentation is to explain how to use tools which are all there, just waiting to make developing, testing, and distributing our Python packages easier. Doesn't matter if you're a Python expert or a beginner - the knowledge covered by this presentation will be useful despite your level.

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-10 - PyCharm Room]
[Rimini, Italy]

A global atmospheric model play an important role in short-term weather forecasting and long-term climate prediction. The model requires enormous computing resources because the all atmospheric states must be calculated every time step (usually a tens of seconds to several minutes). However, since the most atmospheric models run only on CPU machines, they are not able to use the modern microprocessors with high performance and low power such as NVIDIA GPU and Intel MIC.

It often costs a lot to convert codes from one machine to the other machine.  Although it can be accelerated on GPU and MIC using OpenMP and OpenACC directives, it is not easy to achieve peak performance. I developed a new Python module named PyMIP (Python based Machine Independent Platform) to integrate C, Fortran, CUDA and OpenCL codes with a simple user interface. The main code includes configuration, flow control, IO and MPI parallel is written by Python. Only hotspots include huge number crunching code are written by compile language as C, Fortran, CUDA and OpenCL. The hotspot codes are compiled and imported using PyMIP in runtime. PyMIP enables that a user can switch machines with simple flag.

I am developing a new global atmospheric model based on PyMIP to make it easy to utilize various modern microprocessors.  In this presentation, I will introduce PyMIP and show the computational performance result in NVIDIA GPU of the dynamical core of the model developed based on PyMIP.

The very small 2-person DevOps team within Red Hat Performance/Scale Engineering has developed a set of Open Source Python-based systems and network automation provisioning tools designed to end-to-end automate the provisioning of large-scale systems and network switches using tools like Foreman, Ansible, and other Open Source bits.

QUADS – or “quick and dirty scheduler” allows a normally overburdened DevOps warrior to fully automate large swaths of systems and network devices based on a schedule, even set systems provisioning to fire off in the future so they can focus on important things like Netflix and popcorn or not reading your emails while your datacenter burns in an inferno of rapid, automated skynet provisioning. QUADS will also auto-generate up-to-date infrastructure documentation, track scheduling, systems assignments and more.

In this talk we’ll show you how we’re using QUADS (backed by Foreman) to empower rapid, meaningful performance and scale testing of Red Hat products and technologies. While QUADS is a new project and under constant development, the design approach to handling large-scale systems provisioning as well as the current codebase is consumable for others interested in improving the efficiency and level of automation within their infrastructure.

While consistent hashing is largely known and adopted in the NoSQL database clusters to solve data distribution and data access reliability, it is less known and used by the typical developers.

This talk will introduce you to consistent hashing and the problems it solves while going through a practical use case in a python application.

We will start from its standalone design and scale it out to an optimized clustered version thanks to consistent hashing.

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-11 - PythonAnywhere Room]
[Rimini, Italy]

This talk shows what Python Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) are and how they can be used to categorise objects and implement a virtual inheritance tree. The goal of the talk is to introduce programmers to the concept of ABCs, and to show that metaclasses are not a terribly complex topic, but something that can be used by normal programmers. The talk is divided in three different “levels of difficulty”, each of one going deeper in the technical aspects of the subject.

Level 1: Polymorphism - Behaviours and delegation - Collections
The first level is meant to give a quick overview of the collections package and some useful code snippets. Even beginners can benefit of the information given here. To complete this level you only need to know what a try/except block is.

Level 2: Registering - Abstract Base Classes - Categories
The second level shows what real and virtual inheritance are, explains what is the meaning of registering and defines Abstract Base Classes. To complete this level you need to know what class inheritance is (i.e. what class MyList(list) means).

Level 3: Build your ABCs - Metaclasses - ABSs as interfaces
The third level shows how to create your own ABCs, why metaclasses are involved and why they are not a difficult concept. I will then quickly review a possible use of metaclasses as interfaces. To complete this level you need to know how to instantiate a class, and the difference between class and instance.

Serverless computing: it is the practice of building and running services and applications without having to worry about provisioning and managing servers. Serverless computing has been a popular topic the past couple years, and with respect to Python, there have been various different frameworks and tools released for developing and managing your Python serverless applications. This talk will focus on developing and managing your serverless applications with chalice (https://github.com/awslabs/chalice), a python serverless microframework for AWS. Discussion points for this talk will include, but not be limited to:

•   Overview of serverless applications

•   Best practices in writing a serverless application

•    Basic usage and core features of chalice

•   Writing complete, production-level applications using chalice

•   Managing and maintaining serverless applications using chalice tooling

By the end of the talk, audience members should have a better understanding of serverless computing and how to use chalice to develop and maintain serverless applications.

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-11 - Anfiteatro 2]
[Rimini, Italy]

In the wake of famous talk “Stop Writing Classes” by Jack Diederich (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9pEzgHorH0), I’d like to present a pattern that can be used to design clean and pythonic interfaces for programmers based on replacing single-method classes with decorated functions.

This pattern is already used by some famous frameworks and libraries, like Pyramid (https://trypyramid.com/), but I believe it isn’t that well-known to many (even experienced) Python developers and is not as widely used as it deserves.

I’ll show how this pattern can be employed to improve a programming interface which is used by an internal log processing framework at Yelp. This will demonstrate how a more functional approach, leveraging the power of Python decorators, can lead to simpler, more beautiful and easier to understand code.

However, this talk doesn’t suggest giving up classes altogether, but making use of them only when they are truly useful. In fact, the use-case I’m going to analyze will combine classes, functions, and decorators to make the best out of these tools.

Given that the presentation is going to be very code-oriented, the talk is intended for an audience of developers who are already familiar with most Python constructs, including decorators, even though the concept will be briefly introduced at the beginning of the talk. But, if you are one of these people, I promise you that the code will speak for itself.

Exactly 23 years have passed since release of one of the biggest IT classics - """"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software"""". Contents of the book had considerable influence on dominant programming languages of those days. However, design patterns were not glorified by everyone. Voices of rational critic appeared, pointing out that design patterns are just ways to compensate for missing languages features by tons of clumsy code. If one implements design patterns in Python by the book, they will get code that looks awkward, at best. This talk is to present Python's features that either simplifies or eliminates need for implementing design patterns. Even if you don't know what design patterns are - don't worry. You still may see some new interesting Python's features and their usage.

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-11 - Anfiteatro 2]
[Rimini, Italy]

The practice in the development of advanced web applications is to break it into two main areas where the effort on the server, with the typical WSGI environments, focuses on data access configuration whereas the application logic is delegated mostly to the client through the use of JavaScript frameworks.

The reason for this separation into two roles lies in the need to use JavaScript on the browser and the fact that the communication channel (HTTP) and the way in which the application state is handled on the server side is still that thought to serve full web pages.

In this talk I'll show a framework and an application where the line between the two worlds is blurred and where it is possible to think of the application in terms of unity, with the two components that cooperate equally and communicate without thinking in terms of URLs or HTTP verbs .

This is made possible by the asynchronous/reactive management of the processing from the database driver to the user interaction, the use of websocket for communication and the use of Python (optional) for the development of the client part.

Some technologies used are: PostgreSQL, the """"asyncpg"""" driver, the """"aiohttp"""" web server, Crossbar (http://crossbar.io) for the websocket comms, pkg """"metapensiero.sphinx.patchdb"""" for schema upgrades, the package """"metapensiero.reactive"""" and """"metapensiero.signal"""" for the management of reactive event streams,the package """"Javascripthon"""" for Py3 to ES6 JS transpiling.

8) Is it really beneficial?
9) How such execution can be achieved?

As the outline shows I will focus on the parallel part as it is an important topic in our current time of multicore processors and multiprocessor systems.

The topic has been discussed a lot of times but mainly from the scientific point of view, where it's been used for speeding up calulcations time.  I will not go into these use cases (e.g. using MPI) but rather discuss it from web development point of view (e.g. multi worker applications).

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-11 - Arengo]
[Rimini, Italy]

Building web applications is one of the most common uses of Python. With a plethora of different web frameworks aiming at varying audiences, it has become a rather simple and well-documented process to develop web applications and web services. So popular it has become that the WSGI specification is the industry standard protocol for developing web applications with Python.
But the WSGI standard is lacking with two major limitations:


It supports only the ‘traditional’ synchronous http request-response cycle thus creating a ‘glass ceiling’ with the amount of requests a single server can handle – often described as the C10K problem
It does not provide an easy and efficient way of developing two-way communication between servers and clients. Often referred to as the real-time web this capability has become increasingly popular with modern web applications. 


Over the past decade multiple networking libraries have been developed to address these limitations. 
In this talk we will explore:


What is an asynchronous web server and how it differs from other, WSGI-based web servers. 
What is concurrency and how it can help us achieve supreme performance and scalability in our web applications. We will survey noteworthy libraries which will help achieve true concurrency. 
How to develop real-time communication, using web sockets, with our Javascript application
Concerns, limitations and pitfalls when developing asynchronous web applications.

[Rimini, Italy]

Asynchronous programming is becoming a hot topic in the Python community, especially with the rise of popularity of Python 3 and the new asyncio library in its standard library. However, it can still be a confusing and mysterious concept. In this talk, I will explain what async programming is, how it works and how it could benefit you. My goal of this talk is that at the end of it, you have an idea about what we mean when we say asynchronous programming in Python and you know how and when to use it.

In the first part of the talk, I will dive into what asynchronous programming is and what it isn't. Explaining the difference between IO bound code and CPU bound code. 

Then I will explain how this actually works in Python, explaining the idea of an event loop, coroutines and cooperative multitasking. 

Finally, I will talk about why this may be beneficial, what kind of applications can really benefit from this and provide some examples from my experience.

Python is full of amazing (yet often overlooked) features, that can help us write better, cleaner, and more maintainable code. One of them is the descriptors interface.

By means of descriptors, we can run code when accessing or setting properties of another object. This can have a lot of applications, and keeping descriptors in mind might come in handy when facing a hard problem.

The goal of the talk is to explore descriptors, and how they can be written, as well as analysing some interesting examples in well-known libraries or projects in order to identify scenarios where descriptors are the Pythonic way to go.

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-11 - Anfiteatro 2]
[Rimini, Italy]

Imagine you have some streaming computations running on a server. Client programs subscribe to real-time updates, so that they may visualise the computations for end users. 

How do you share this constantly changing server state with all connected clients? Sending an entire snapshot after each change is very inefficient, so you must implement some sort of incremental updates – diffs. 

But how do you generate these diffs on the server? And how do you represent them so the clients know how to apply them to update their own state?

We have been working on these problems for a long time while building a stock trading platform in Python. I'd like to show you a couple of open source libraries that we developed for this purpose, and share our experience with tracking state and propagating it to user interfaces running in other processes.

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-11 - Anfiteatro 2]
[Rimini, Italy]

There are as many different ways to package an application as there are programming or scripting languages. No one tool or library is in itself better than another; however when security comes into the picture, there is definitely a pattern between ease of installation and how secure the delivered application is. As more work is put into packaging the application, more measures can be taken in order to ensure its integrity and prevent security issues.

This talk will cover:
- The roles involved in the lifecycle of an application, from the start of the development process until it reaches the end user and it is actually used.
- The inherent problems in this subject, regarding installation and security, as well as how they are related.
- The different ways of packaging an application in order to deliver it to an end user, focused on a Python perspective.

After the talk, attendees will have a better grasp on which is the best way for them to package and deliver their application according to their environment and target audience. They will also learn about the upgrade path to switch from one delivery method to another, should they need or want to.

For this talk, it is desired that attendees have some general systems knowledge. Even though the talk will be focused on Python applications, some knowledge of information security is desired.

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-11 - PyCharm Room]
[Rimini, Italy]

Threads are typically not the way to take advantage of multiple CPUs for CPU-bound problems. The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) allows the use of only one CPU at the time when using threads. However, the GIL is released for IO task

The use case is a scientific simulation model that has to run 18,000 different simulations. The input data for these simulations need to be extracted from a common database, re-assembled and translated into several input files per simulation. After each simulation that is run with an external, standalone executable, the output data needs to be gathered and rearranged in a output database.

The implementation scaled up to 50 threads. On a eight-core machine more than 90 % usage of all CPUs could be achieved, bringing the total run time down to about two hours from about 15 hours.

Depending on the use case, threading can help to speedup a program and even take advantage of multiple CPUs. This talk presents such a use case. The approach can be translated to problems from other domains if the sub-tasks can be turned into IO tasks.

Asynchronous programming could have been used here. However using a thread per task and using class that represents a task, is likely conceptually simpler for programmers not used to asynchronous programming.

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-11 - PyCharm Room]
[Rimini, Italy]

SAP operates one of the largest test infrastructure to test its in-memory database SAP HANA. The infrastructure provides different services like continues integration, code coverage and code linting for a huge C++ project with Python test coding. These services are essential for the development teams and quality specialists. Without these services developing and shipping of new SAP HANA version wouldn’t be possible.
In 2010, we started with a single Jenkins master with ten nodes. But to keep our testing time acceptable for the growing number of developers we had to scale up and that led to multiple different scaling challenges. The current test infrastructure is powered by more than thousand physical servers. Scaling of the infrastructure was only possible with custom optimizations like improved scheduling, expressive test configuration and robust tooling implemented in our favorite language Python. With the flexibility and power of Python it’s possible for developers to implement complex test scenarios to verify features and mitigate regressions. On infrastructure side, it has been easier to extend, optimize and adapt the infrastructure for new requirements like different CPU architectures and newer Operating systems versions.

This talk provides insights and stories how we scaled and improved our test infrastructure and how new technologies like Linux Containers can improve automated testing and software quality assurance.

Looking at state of the art approaches to using python in gaming, we will compare the alternatives: pygame (2D API), OpenGL (via pygame/pySDL2), Unreal Engine 4 and the Godot Engine (with further comparison to Unity 3D game engine).

We will also look at other benefits of using python in the gaming context, such as integration with 3D modelling software, scripting the asset pipeline and GIS data integration.

Finally, can (and should) python move beyond being the language of plugins and scripts, and become the main language for creating game development projects?

The DevOps methodology is reality. That said, many developers have to deal with the process of bringing python applications into production.
One aphorism of the Zen of Python states: """"There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.""""
While for the language itself and code being written with it, this advice is often strictly followed for good reasons. For the process of bringing python into production it is not.

In the first part of this talk I will give an overview of the different steps in the delivery pipeline, from packaging to deployment and the various possible implementations for each of those steps that emerged over the last years. We will discuss docker, pex, wheels, debs, and tars. We will learn why fixed environments are crucial and why pip is not yet what it should be. We learn about the different runtime environments, from bare metal servers over ephemeral container clusters to “serverless” and what they impose on the deployment process and scratch on the surface of configuration management using tools like Ansible and orchestration frameworks like Kubernetes. We will also explore the world beyond python by looking into other languages ecosystems and learn how they addressed and solved this issue.

After we understood the requirements and realized that there is not """"one obvious way to do it"""", this talk is a call to action: Let us define and build the “one obvious way” of how we want to bring python into production!

When starting a new project, as developers we usually get right into hacking things, like tinkering with libs that we would like to learn or solving a particular problem as quickly a possible. Occasionally we also decide to publish the resulting package to PyPI, so that others can use our nifty code, submit a pull request and maybe even form a community around the project.

If you're lucky someone might find it on the front-page of PyPI or the GitHub search or maybe even Hacker News or Reddit. What happens next is on you really.  But what does that mean?

Before jumping right to the command line and installing your package, those who are interested usually try to find out what problems the project is solving and how it can help them with their own. That's what your README file is for - it's most likely the first thing potential users read, that you control.

A good README briefly and concisely explains what your software does, how it can be installed and what API it exposes. You also want to provide information on the requirements, the license it uses and how the project is managed. Who are you? How to get in touch to report problems and give feedback? Where can I find the Code of Conduct for this project?

This talk is for everyone who is interested in working on open source projects and wants to know how documentation can help newcomers and more experienced users use your code and to encourage them to engage in the community.

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-12 - PyCharm Room]
[Rimini, Italy]

In the experimental Sciences, new theories are developed by applying the Scientific method to produce results which are accurate, reproducible and reliable. This involves testing the experimental setup to show that it is working as designed and thoroughly documenting the progress of the experiment. Results will not be trusted unless the experiment has been carried out to a suitable standard.

In computational Science, we should aim to apply the same principles. Results should only be trusted if the code that has produced it has undergone rigorous testing which demonstrates that it is working as intended, and any limitations of the code (e.g. numerical errors) are understood and quantified. The code should be well documented so that others can understand how it works and run it themselves to replicate results.

Unfortunately, this can be quite challenging. By their very nature, scientific codes are built to investigate systems where the behaviour is to some extent unknown, so testing them can be quite difficult. They can be very complex, built over a number of years (or even decades!) with contributions from many people. However, even for the most complicated of codes there are a number of different tools we can use to build robust, reliable code.

In this talk, I shall look at techniques and tools you can use to build more sustainable scientific code, including testing, continuous integration and documentation.

Realtime distributed computing is tough, especially at scale: managing a large data pipeline is tough, and it’s even tougher to keep latency low and availability high when processing tens of thousands of items per second. Many people turn in despair to Java or Scala when it comes time to scale up, but we can do it in Python: Apache Storm is a distributed realtime computation system that can let you scale up- and no need to reach for a new language!

This talk will walk the audience through the basics of Apache Storm and how it’s an elegant, useful solution to realtime distributed computing,  as well as how streamparse can let you write your storm components in Python by writing some code and a basic storm topology in Python. We’ll also look at how Parsely uses Storm in production to handle billions of realtime events a month. If we have time, we’ll go a bit into how Storm has several advantages over other common Python computing data streaming solutions, like Spark’s microbatching.

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-12 - Anfiteatro 1]
[Rimini, Italy]

In close collaboration with scientists from MPG, the Max Planck Computing and Data Facility is engaged in the development and optimization of algorithms and applications for high performance computing, as well as in the design and implementation of solutions for data-intensive projects. Python is now used at MPCDF in the emerging area of “atom probe crystallography” (APT): a Fourier spectral analysis in 3D reciprocal space can be simulated in order to reveal both composition and crystallographic structure at the atomic scale of billions APT experimental data sets. The Python data ecosystem has proved to be well suited to this, as it has grown beyond the confines of single machines to embrace scalability. This talk aims to describe our approach to scaling across multiple GPUs, and the role of our visualization methods too. Our data workflow analysis relies on the GPU-accelerated Python software package called PyNX, an open source Python library which provides fast parallel computation scattering. The code is well suited for GPU computing, using both the pyCUDA and pyOpenCL libraries. Exploratory data analysis and performance tests are initially carried on through Jupyter notebooks and Python packages e.g., pandas, matplotlib, plotly. In production stage, interactive visualization is realized by using standard scientific tool, e.g. Paraview, an open-source 3D visualization program which e.g. requires Python modules to generate visualization components within VTK files.

The pandas library represents a very efficient and convenient tool for data manipulation, but sometimes hides unexpected pitfalls which can arise in various and sometimes unintelligible ways.

By briefly referring to some aspects of the implementation, I will review specific situations in which a change of approach can make code based on pandas more robust, or more performant.

Some examples:

inefficient indexing
multiple dtypes and efficiency
implicit type casting
HDF5 storage overhead
GroupBy.apply()... when you don't actually need it

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-12 - Anfiteatro 1]
[Rimini, Italy]

In the last years climate change has become one of the most important topic. For any period longer than a few days science is not able to provide comparable forecasts, but still a lot of useful information about future climate conditions can be gained on time scale of a few months to even several years.

Climate forecast and climate projections data are quite complex to analyse and represent. The Python science ecosystem proves extremely effective as a platform to retrieve, analyse, process and present this type of data. The backbone of the platform is the n-dimensional array library xarray that provides the perfect mix between pandas data structures and dask performance and parallelization.

Reliable climate forecasts and climate projections are now available from the Copernicus Climate Change Service, operated by ECMWF, that will become the central hub for European effort in study and mitigate climate change impacts. The service also provides access to an open cloud platform, the CDS Toolbox, that is based on the Python 3 xarray/dask/pandas stack.

In this talk I will present how to retrieve, analyse, process and display climate data in a generic use case with xarray and with the Copernicus CDS Toolbox.

[Rimini, Italy]

PyRT (pronounced """"pirate"""") is a rather new open source project creating a ray tracer in pure Python and some optional CPU/GPU acceleration using bindings. Ray tracing is a technique for generating an image by tracing the path of light. 
PyRT was created to render large 3D City models. In this talk, the possibilities and experiences of ray tracing in Python using pyRT are shown. pyRT also runs in the Jupyter Notebook.
Rendering complex 3D-Geodata, such as 3D-City models with an extremely high polygon count and a vast amount of textures at interactive framerates is still a very challenging task, especially on mobile devices. This talk presents an approach for processing, caching and serving massive geospatial data in a cloud-based environment for large scale, out-of-core, highly scalable 3D scene rendering in a web-based solution. PyRT  is used for rendering large amounts of geospatial data. The approach for processing, rendering and caching 3D-City Models is shown.

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-12 - Arengo]
[Rimini, Italy]

Simple is better than complex, right? That’s true for data pipelines too.

For more than 5 years, I hacked together extract-transform-load (ETL) processes in various different positions (ETL is just a fancy term for «bunch of things that take data somewhere and put it elsewhere, eventually transformed»).

I did it as a founder, as a consultant, as a technical co-founder, for some side projects, and now in a big corp (to be continued…).

In each case, I felt frustrated with the tools available, and in some serious cases, I had to hack things myself to get the job done.

https://www.bonobo-project.org/

Bonobo is the repackaging of my past experiences for python 3.5+, and grasping the basics should not take more than the length of the presentation.

Topics outline (subject to small changes) :

• INTRO : State of the art / different tools for different needs.

• Where does it come from.

• Writing a data processor.

• Running and monitoring data jobs.

• OUTRO : The road ahead.

• Q&A

Bonobo is the glue you need to tie together regular functions in a transformation graph (think unix pipes). Execution strategies are abstracted so you can focus on the real operations. As a result, you can engineer simple and testable systems, using the same good computer development practices as you use in -insert your favorite field here-.

Spoiler : there is no «big data» in this talk.

Mary had a little lambda,
a function pure as snow.
And for every program that Mary wrote,
the lambda was all she needed to know.

Python’s lambda, a tiny anonymous function, can be useful in a pinch when you’re feeling too lazy to type that extra d-e-f. But did you know that behind this little lambda is actually one of the most powerful &amp; elegant abstractions in the history of computer science? 

The lambda calculus, dating back to the work of lambda shepherd Alonzo Church in the 1930's, lets us represent our programs - all their logic and data - as pure, anonymous functions, using nothing but (a whole lot of) lambda. Let’s take it for a spin and see what we can create: booleans and conditionals, integers, arithmetical operators, data structures… you name it. With some determination, and a little squinting, we might even see lambda do the impossible: reconcile object-oriented and functional programming. You heard it right: lambda can do it all!

Join me as we explore its astounding computational power, and walk away with a deeper respect and admiration for the almighty little lambda.

[Rimini, Italy]

After some experiences in the implementation of full-text search functionality with different system, we have decided to use PostgreSQL to implement full-text search functionality in our next project, a website to search for shows, venues, bands and festivals.

In the past, I have worked in two different projects, a mobile platform to sell and buy used items and a sport videos sharing platform, where I used two of the most currently famous full-text search software (Elasticsearch or Solr) but I had some synchronization and management problems.

After that, in my company, we searched for new Django support of full-text search PostgreSQL implementation and we decided to use it to avoid any problems that I had in the past.

I’m going to start speaking about the full-text search in a general context and I want to show the problems I encountered implementing it in the past.

Afterwards, I’m going to talk about the PostgreSQL functionality to implement the full-text search functionality and also present the django.contrib.potgres.search module, with step-by-step demonstrations of its functions with real world data.

Finally, I’m going to show the way we use and test this functionality in our project and which functionality lacks us to have a complete implementation of full-text search in our project.

At the end, I want to present my conclusions about our solution and I want to explore some new features that will be present in the next versions of Django and PostgreSQL.

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-12 - PythonAnywhere Room]
[Rimini, Italy]

When it comes to microservices, there're a lot of things worth keeping in mind. Designing such fine-grained, loosely-coupled services requires paying lots of attention to various patterns and approaches to make them future-proof. A very important thing to consider, is the way those services will communicate with each-other in production. Usually the communication is done over the network using a technology-agnostic protocol. At the next level the service should provide an API for its friend services. Then, the data should be serialized without altering its meaning and transferred to the picked endpoint.

Nowadays, exposing a REST API that operates with JSON over plain HTTP is a usual way to lay the grounds of communication for the services. It is easy to accomplish, but it has some drawbacks. First of all, JSON is a human readable format, and it’s not as other serialization approaches. Also, with JSON it’s not possible to natively enforce the schema, and evolving the API may be painful.

This talk’s purpose is to describe in deep detail the benefits of protocol buffers, that offer us for free an easy way to define the API messages in the proto format, and then reuse them inside different services, without even being locked to use the same programming language for them. Moreover, with gRPC we can define the API’s endpoints easily in the same proto format. All these offer us a robust schema enforcement, compact binary serialization, and easy backward compatibility.

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-12 - PythonAnywhere Room]

The part of CPython core that parses the Python source code is some very old and convoluted code: the time has proven its reliability, but few CPython hackers understand (or care) how it works, or even what exactly it does. There is, however, a good reason to care: for short-running scripts, the performance of CPython may easily be dominated by that of parsing the source code.

The talk will describe the two parsers that are involved, it will explain how these two parsers build two different kinds of syntax trees, and then show how the structure of one of the trees can be amended to reduce its memory footprint threefold, with only minor changes necessary in its consumers. It will also suggest other, more invasive improvements, which can yield even better savings.

The talk will assume fluency in C and a basic acquaintance with CPython core internals, and will give the attendees an introduction into hacking the parser, guiding their way through to the very tangible end result of reducing Python overall memory consumption by up to 30%, measured at standard micro-benchmarks.

Having a basic knowledge of JavaScript is obligatory for every Web developer in todays world. Most of us are familiar with the pain of having to write some simple hide/show logic and ajax queries with jQuery on a page that is mostly rendered server-side. Nowadays, however, there are lots of great JavaScript frameworks and build tools that not only make these things very easy to do The Right Way, but also make the whole process quite painless.

I spent past year in a small startup writing only front-end code and evaluating different tools and best practises. Bringing these tools to old Django projects has been eye-opening. There are practically no documentation or code examples on how to integrate these things to Python backend projects, so it’s very hard to get started from scratch. In this talk we’ll go trough some of the tools, examples on how to get started, and also some coding guidelines on how to make JavaScript look and feel more sane and Pythonic.

The current state of JavaScript frameworks is notoriously bad; there are more of them than blog engines written with Django. We’ll focus on Vue.js (https://vuejs.org) which is a lightweight, very easy to get started and yet powerful tool.

We’ll also take a look at new end-to-end browser test tools and modern build tools that enable us to take full advantage of the huge NPM package universe (Cheeseshop for JS)  and write modern ES2015/ES2016 JavaScript that has more powerful and cleaner syntax.

The joy of PyPy JIT: abstractions for free

The PyPy JIT is a powerful piece of technology which makes Python program
running faster: in this talk, we will see how it helps us to write our
programs better without sacrificing performance.

One of the key to write complex software systems of good quality is to make a
good usage of abstractions, to clearly separate the various layers and
components.  However, often each layer of abstraction adds some cost in terms
of runtime performance, so we need to struggle finding the best trade-off
between maintainability and speed.

Because of the way it works, the PyPy JIT naturally removes the cost of most
abstractions: we will look at real-life examples of how this is possible,
showing what the JIT can and can't do. We will also show how this compares to
other popular systems of optimizing Python code, such as Cython.

Python is slow ! Python can’t access bare metal!

You often hear theses assumptions? Theses limitations can be surpassed by Python extensions written in C. However, according to my personal experience, doing this by leveraging C may yield to several issues (e.g., memory management).

C Foreign Function Interface for Python (a.k.a., CFFI) allows you to easily write Python extensions. One of the main aims of CFFI is to to wrap C libraries. Along the same lines, it may also be used for performance enhancement.

By this call, I am firstly presenting CFFI and it’s two modes of utilization: API level and ABI level. Then I will share my own experience about wrapping shaderc library (https://github.com/google/shaderc) in six hours pyshaderc (https://github.com/realitix/pyshaderc).

Next we are going to the next level, let’s wrap all the Vulkan API! Vulkan is the new 3D API and is not a piece of cake. To see the real advantage of CFFI, a side by side comparison between two Python modules is going to be presented:

CVulkan is a Vulkan wrapper written fully in C, it’s a classic C extension for Python
vulkan is its CFFI counterpart without any C written, only Python

I have developed two versions of Vulkan wrapper (one in a pure C, and the second by leveraging CFFI) and I can assure you that CFFI is a a way better!

Let’s code!

http://www.geosci-model-dev.net/5/55/2012/
Scientific aircraft research flights have to be planned beforehand.
For that it is necessary to have model forecasts of relevant quantities such as meteorological parameters, chemical composition or particle information to guide the aircraft to the location of interest. Typically, many scientific instruments on board those aircrafts used to investigate e.g. the chemical composition of the air in order to get new insights often with the involvement of different science groups.

For discussion of the possibilites of the research flights, the Mission Support System (MSS) was developed (http://mss.rtfd.io). This software helps to review a big amount of metereological and model data by viewing the forecasted parameters of interest along possible regions of a proposed flight path. Data and possible flight paths can be displayed on a hoizontal view (map projection) or on a vertical view (along the proposed flight path). Flight paths can be constructed and modified on these views. Exchange through a waypoint table is also possible.

The talk gives a brief insight into the MSS software development current state.

We are using the OWS interface standard. https://geopython.github.io/OWSLib/ MSS is a client/server application. The QT client interacts with a paste wsgi server. The software is available for all platforms on conda-forge.

Python was never intended as a fast language but many modern uses of Python require high performance computing, particularly in data science. This talk explores your options for squeezing maximum performance out of critical Python code.

This talk provides a succinct summary of the options you have: C extensions, Cython, CFFI, PyPy and many others. It also shows the trade-offs between execution performance and the cost of writing and maintaining code with each choice. Each option is also explored for maturity and ease of use for Python programmers. A real world programming problem is coded and benchmarked using each of these techniques. All the code used in the talk is available on GitHub.

At the end of this talk you will be better place to decide on which technique to use to make your code run 100x faster.

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-13 - PyCharm Room]
[Rimini, Italy]

Declarative Programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on describing what should be computed in a problem domain without describing how it should be done.  The talk starts by explaining differences between a declarative and imperative approach with the help of examples from everyday life. Having established a clear notion of declarative programming as well as pointed out some advantages, we transfer these concepts to programming in general. For example, the usage of control flow statements like loops over-determine the order of computation which impedes scalable execution as well as it often violates the single level of abstraction principle.

Following the theoretical part of the talk, some practical examples are given how declarative programming can be applied easily within Python. This comprises the advantages and disadvantages of using a configuration file, e.g. config.yaml, versus a Python configuration module, e.g. setup.py. Furthermore, the benefits of avoiding statements of control flow with the help of list and dictionary comprehensions as well as sets are demonstrated.

The talk is concluded by a short, high-level excursion to a logistic programming language, namely PyDatalog in order to build the bridge between logistic and declarative programming. This is accomplished by showing how a mathematical crossword can be easily solved with the help of declarative and logistic programming.

Despite 12 years of history and wide popularity the workings of Git still remain largely a mystery for many.  A lot of Git users operate it just by remembering a bunch of commands and repeating them in a correct order.  I was one of them until I decided to dig deeper into how Git actually works and suddenly I understood that internally Git operates by rather simple principles and after you figure them out suddenly all those commands start to make sense. To look into the Git's internal structure you need a programming language to crunch the data and Python fit perfectly for this task.

In this talk, I will dig into the internals of Git with Python, that will help you better understand how Git works.

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-13 - PyCharm Room]
[Rimini, Italy]

Damn it, this can’t be happening! As programmers, we find ourselves time and again spiralling down into tighter loops of desperate troubleshooting, fighting the controls of our machinery and descending into what feels like a kind of madness. Later, when it’s all over, we realise that the clues we needed to recover the situation were staring us in the face all along, but we somehow couldn’t even see them.

There’s a reason for this: the nature of debugging for programmers means that it quickly tips us into these states, and then very effectively keeps us there.

In programming we have worked hard to improve some aspects of programmers’ work, creating methodologies, development frameworks, paradigms, practices and thinking deeply about how to solve the problems of producing good code. We have done very little work to improve the way we debug our code,

The good news is that although programmers have not developed very adequate strategies or techniques for mitigating the risks that debugging draws us into, other industries, and in particular aviation, have. We can learn from their lessons without paying their price.

ML estimators don't have to be black boxes. Interpretability has many benefits: it is easier to debug interpretable models, humans trust decisions of such models more.

In this talk I’ll give an overview of ML models interpretation and debugging techniques. I’ll cover

linear models,
decision trees, 
tree ensembles, 
arbitrary classifiers using LIME algorithm.

The talk focus is on explanation algorithms, because it is important to be aware of pitfalls and limitations of the explanation method to be able to interpret an explanation correctly. I’ll also show how to use these techniques in practice, to debug and explain behavior of estimators from Python ML libraries like scikit-learn and xgboost using open-source eli5 library:
https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/eli5 .

Attendees will get both practical and theoretical understanding of these explanation methods. Target audience is ML practitioners who want to 

1) get a better quality from their ML pipelines - understanding of why a wrong decision happens is often a first step to improve the quality of an ML solution;

2) explain ML model behavior to clients or stakeholders - inspectable ML pipelines are easier to “sell” to a client; humans trust such models more because they can check if an explanation is consistent with their domain knowledge or gut feeling, understand better shortcomings of the solution and make a more informed decision as a result.

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-13 - Anfiteatro 1]
[Rimini, Italy]

Every time a new batch of data comes in, you start a set of tasks. Some tasks can run in parallel, some must run in a sequence, perhaps on a number of different machines. That's a workflow.

Did you ever draw a block diagram of your workflow? Imagine you could bring that diagram to life and actually run it as it looks on the whiteboard. With Airflow you can just about do that.

http://airflow.apache.org
Apache Airflow is an open-source Python tool for orchestrating data processing pipelines. In each workflow tasks are arranged into a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Shape of this graph decides the overall logic of the workflow. A DAG can have many branches and you can decide which of them to follow and which to skip at execution time.

This creates a resilient design because each task can be retried multiple times if an error occurs. Airflow can even be stopped entirely and running workflows will resume by restarting the last unfinished task. Logs for each task are stored separately and are easily accessible through a friendly web UI.

In my talk I will go over basic Airflow concepts and through examples demonstrate how easy it is to define your own workflows in Python code. We'll also go over ways to extend Airflow by adding custom task operators, sensors and plugins.

Serverside applications are more and more likely to need to run in
dynamic cloud environments where they can automatically scale as
required.  One rightfully popular approach is to run the application
as a Docker container inside a Kubernetes cluster, giving you a lot of
operational benefits thanks to the Kubernetes folks.

For the most part it is rather easy to make your Python application
work inside a Docker container.  But there are a number of common
patterns one can follow to save time by delegating more things to the
runtime environment.  Furthermore you can start adding a few simple
non-intrusive features to your application which will help improve the
application live-cycle in the cluster, ensuring smooth hand-over when
migrating the container to different nodes or scaling it up or down.

This talk will quickly cover the basics of Kubernetes and will then
start from a simple program and will discuss the steps to take to make
it behave well in this environment.  Starting with the basics steps
you can rely on the runtime for, covering logging and all the way to
supporting the service life-cycle, health checking and monitoring in a
Kubernetes environment.  You will see that building a cloud-native
application is not very hard and something you can gradually
introduce.

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-13 - Anfiteatro 2]
[Rimini, Italy]

When developing and maintaining many different services, unit testing is not enough to make sure your code works in production. By now, many teams doing SOA (service-oriented architectures) have a set of end-to-end tests that cover critical workflows to make sure these work. For these tests, all of the utilized services need to have the proper test fixture data in their datastores. This often leads to developers having to deal with raw datastore data (like JSON or SQL) for these tests, making the authoring of those tests very slow, tedious, and error-prone.

This talk is going to discuss several approaches we tried at Yelp to generating these fixture data in a quicker, developer-friendly and more correct way. 

The main part of the talk will be a deep-dive into what fixture factories are, how to implement them and how to integrate them with pytest, the leading Python testing framework. I'll show you several other benefits this approach has over writing raw fixture data and how this leads to more maintainable and easier to adapt code. We'll also explore how you can then run your tests in parallel, cutting down runtime drastically.

You think, all that hype about streaming solutions does not affect you? I thought so also. But when playing around with that topic for some time, I realized that it sheds a different light on many topics I struggled with for some time. In this talk I want to share with you what I discovered when switching from a from a database centric view to stream oriented processing. 

Splitting your application in smaller services gets easier as you have more natural boundaries
You have more options to run different data schema versions in different services (instead of one central db upgrade)
More scaling possibilities
Operations improvements

For sure, streaming does not solve any problem, but much more than I thought before. And in python you have good support with many streaming clients. I will give some examples and comparisons for working with Kafka and Avro Schemas.

Hotjar’s user recordings count above 400 million, with supporting tables containing 4.5 billion records. This 5TB data fits nicely into Postgres and doesn’t quite merit the full big data suite of tools. However, at the rate of 1000 recordings per minute, and overall request rate of 750K per minute, the penalty of inefficient queries and updates can quickly cause nasty performance spikes if not thought out well.
This talk is about the challenges we faced at the lower end of big data: the good decisions which helped keep our application running and other lessons we had to learn the hard way

Considerations for Database Design


Design entities for the domain
Balance normalization with performance
Sharding later has big migration costs, consider designing for this early

Speak to the database from your Web Application


Why use ORMs and at which level of abstraction?
Stored Procedures are fast, should we have more of those?

Bringing data closer to the application


Materialize Views
Defer aggregations
Application Level Caching

Handling Operational Troubles


Explain(analyze, buffers) is your friend

Reduce Deadlocks

Reducing Impact of Background Maintenance Jobs


Keep impact on database low with cursors and streaming

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-13 - PythonAnywhere Room]
[Rimini, Italy]

Did you ever think, Django and all the other “batteries included” frameworks are not flexible enough for your needs? Do you feel like they limit you in your creativity and design? Then this talk is for you!

Werkzeug is a very lightweight HTTP/WSGI utility for Python. You might have actually used it before, since the popular framework Flask is based on it.
Werkzeug handles the WSGI communication with the web server and parsing of HTTP packets for you, after that, you are left to do whatever you want. No pre-defined ORM, no request dispatching or template rendering. 
As a developer you are supported with a live debugger that runs in the browser and a great variety of testing tools making it easy to write fine grained unit tests for your application.

As a developer at MPS - Medical Systems, I work with Werkzeug on a daily basis. One of our products is ChemoCompile,  a chemo therapy planning, management and documentation tool used in hospitals in various European countries. It is a single-page web application written in Python (backend) and AngularJS (frontend). When we created it, we first prototyped it using Django, but soon realized, that we did not need most of the functionality that Django provides and many of our needs, like interfacing with hospital information systems, are too much out of the scope of a regular web applications. I will talk about, how we then discovered Werkzeug and built our own very customized stack on top of it and how you can do it too!

Python 3.5 introduced support for """"type hints"""" (or annotations), which allows us to annotate our code with useful bits of information without affecting its runtime behavior. Type hints don't enforce a particular use case and can therefore be used for many purposes.

In my talk, I will explain some of the use cases of type hints, and show how we can use them to e.g. make our code more secure or teach it new tricks. We will have a look at popular libraries that help us to use the power of type hints (e.g. mypy), but we will also see how we can build our own extensions on top of the type hint system.

After the talk you should walk away with a solid (basic) understanding of type hints in Python and an idea of how they might be useful to you now or in the future.

Network automation and orchestration is the latest phase in the evolution of IP and optical networks.
Over the last few years, network engineers have created a variety of libraries and softwares to help them with the management, configuration and automation of huge networks made of hundreds of thousands of network devices (e.g. routers, switches, antenna...).

In this talk, I will introduce NetDim, a vendor-neutral software for network modeling and automation based on the standard Python library for GUI programming: tkinter.

I will start the presentation with an introduction to network visualization, and show how tkinter can be used to implement graph drawing algorithms, as well as a full-on Geographic Information System (GIS), allowing one to place network devices on a world map at their GPS coordinates.

I will then discuss the whys and wherefores of network automation, and show how to automatically generate and push scripts to a network device via SSH or Telnet.

PyTorch is an optimized tensor library for Deep Learning, and is a recent newcomer to the growing list of GPU programming frameworks available in Python. Like other frameworks it offers efficient tensor representations and is agnostic to the underlying hardware. However, unlike other frameworks it allows you to create """"define-by-run"""" neural networks resulting in dynamic computation graphs, where every single iteration can be different---opening up a whole new world of possibilities. Central to all neural networks in PyTorch is the Autograd package, which performs Algorithmic Differentiation on the defined model and generates the required gradients at each iteration. In this talk I will present a gentle introduction to the PyTorch library and overview its main features using some simple examples, paying particular attention to the mechanics of the Autograd package.

Keywords: GPU Processing, Algorithmic Differentiation, Deep Learning, Linear algebra.

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-13 - PythonAnywhere Room]

Authentication, authorization and public key infrastructure are complicated and hard to get right, yet crucial for every infrastructure. Manifold user databases in each application as well as ad-hoc self-signed TLS/SSL certificates don't scale and are hard to administrate. Users don't want to remember a password for each service, admins prefer a centralized PKI, and developers struggle with correct handling of password.

FreeIPA is an Open Source, Python-based identity management solution. It is much more than a simple user database. FreeIPA combines multiple mature products under an easy-to-use installer, command line and web interface: 389-DS LDAP server, MIT Kerberos, Dogtag PKI certificate system, BIND DNS with DNSSEC, SSSD, certmonger and more. It provides identities for users, services and machines with single sign-on (optionally 2FA) and role or host based ACL. Keycloak and Ipsilon IdP can be integrated to offer OpenIDC or SAML. Mutual trust with Active Directory is possible, too.

Installation of a FreeIPA server and integration with a WSGI application is much simpler than you might think.  At the end of my talk you will know how to deploy a FreeIPA server with just one command, how to add replicas for redundancy, how to authenticate users and access user data like name, email and group membership without adding a single line of Kerberos or LDAP code to your application, and how to issue TLS certificates with auto-renewal and OCSP.

When working on a new ML solution to solve a given problem, do you think that you are simply using objective reality to infer a set of unbiased rules that will allow you to predict the future? Do you think that worrying about the morality of your work is something other people should do? If so, this talk is for you.

In this brief time, I will try to convince you that you hold great power over how the future world will look like and that you should incorporate thinking about morality into the set of ML tools you use every day. We will take a short journey through several problems, which surfaced over the last few years, as ML and AI generally, became more widely used. We will look at bias present in training data, at some real-world consequences of not considering it (including one or two hair-raising stories) and cutting-edge research on how to counteract this.

The outline of the talk is: - Intro the problem: ML algos can be biased! - Two concrete examples. - What's been done so far (i.e. techniques from recently-published papers). - What to do next: unanswered questions.

We will show practical examples of different visualizations of geographical data:

First, we will start with how to use bokeh to overlay data on google maps. We will use examples to show how the GMapPlot interface works. We will briefly explain how to use it,  and what are its limitations. 

Then, we will talk about plotting shapefiles with holoviews. Shapefiles are files that describe the shape of maps. We will explain how to deal with shapefiles. For instance, we will describe how we use shapefiles to group geographical data by regions. We will also briefly explain how holoviews works and how it can be used to display geographical data.

Moreover, we will talk about using datashader and geoviews to visualize big data. First, we will briefly introduce datashader, bin based plotting and the datashader Pipeline. After that, we will show how to create plots with geoviews: how is the Interface, a few use cases and some examples. Finally, we will move to plotting big data on interactive maps.

Eventually we will finish with dynamic maps for visualizing time series: we will explain how do we do it and show some examples of how to build an interactive dashboard for visualizing geographical data that varies over time.

programming (importing CSV files in a database) and in scientific
programming (numerical simulations). The initial part of the talk
will be pedagogical, advocating the convenience of parallel programming
in the small (i.e. in single machine environment); the second part will
be more advanced and will touch a few things to know when writing
parallel programs for medium-sized clusters.
I will also briefly discuss the compatibility layer that we have developed at GEM
to be independent from the underlying parallelization technology (multiprocessing,
concurrent.futures, celery, ipyparallel, grid engine...).

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-14 - PythonAnywhere Room]
[Rimini, Italy]

The first weekend of October 2015 my company bought an advert during the first episode of """"Downton Abbey"""" on Sunday evening. 
It was so successful that the website went down for half an hour.
We wanted to look at the analytics and the data to estimate the impact.
But they were having a very hard weekend too: the replica of the production database we used was unreachable and the only person who knew how to fix it was on a plane.
Monday really was a memorable day

This session is about sharing some life experience and best practices around Data Engineering.
Attendants should have some previous understanding of data and tech in business.
Attendants should leave with an understanding of on-call practices and with some quick win actions to take.

What does it mean to be on call?

How do you make sure that the phone rings as little as possible?

Fixing versus Root Cause Analysis.
Systems break at junctures.
Especially if the juncture is with a third party.

Why and when is it worth reacting to errors as soon as they happen?

External Services.
Increasing Business Trust.
Allowing others to build on solid ground.


How do you make sure the phone rings when it should?

Alerting tools: emails, chat, specialised applications like PagerDuty, OpsGenie and Twilio
Monitoring systems
Monitoring data (Data Quality) as a continuous early warning system.

Plone CMS, first released in 2001, is now close to its 5.1 version.

Did you know that the 2016 Olympics web site was built with Plone?
Did you know that many huge organizations that care about data protection use Plone?

There are good reason why Plone is such a successful Python project, but probably the most important is that Plone does take into account the security of your data very seriously.

Nowadays, information and data play a crucial role, sometimes they are the more important asset of a company.
They have to be in a digital form and accessible from every device, it is no surprise that they are exposed to a growing threat.

During the talk I will review Plone built in security protection systems.
In addition I will review some of its features, like the ability to create, without writing a line of code, custom content types, to change documents workflows, to organize your documents in a snap.

I will also talk about the foreseen new features that will be soon in Plone and I will present Castle CMS and Quaive, some important projects built on top of Plone that are currently under the spotlight.

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-14 - PyCharm Room]
[Rimini, Italy]

Python on mobile devices is still negligible mostly because of the GUI problems which arise. But Python on android devices is considered to be a solved problem since the module Python for Android is available. We have nowadays at least the possibility to develop for mobile devices with the GUI engine Kivy which is maybe the first choice for rapid prototyping on that platform. But as it comes to design work and mobile device look alike Kivy is still far behind the web development tools HTML/CSS.

In our talk we present a conceptual work where we used Ionic - this is an mobile development framework based on Angular - to build the GUI part of an app and connected that to a Python back end. In our point of view our proposal is very general and will give Python a boost towards modern UX development and makes HTML/CSS/JavaScript a real option especially in combination with Angular.
The main part of our solution that we show is the interoperation between JavaScript and Python such that asynchronous calls in both direction are possible. 
The advantage is to develop UX and back end code only once and use it literally on every platform where a Python interpreter and a browser runs.

Microservices architecture and containerization are words thrown around when we talk about designing systems that are loosely coupled, although it may sound like buzz words but these key concepts play a very important part in system as a whole.

In this talk, we will cover how microservices can be implemented in python using available open source frameworks and how it can be deployed independently to scale and perform in production environment. I'll also share several use-cases where it is worth planning and developing system architecture considering microservices/containerization and will also discuss some trade-off of having such architecture.

Outline:


Overview of microservices
Implementing microservices using Python
Advantages of microservices over Monolithic / SoA architecture
Overview of containerization
How to containerize Python based services (Docker)
Advantages of microservices/containerization over traditional deployment
CI/CD Approach in microservices and containerization
Usecases where to use microservices
Trade-off of using microservices

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-14 - PythonAnywhere Room]
[Rimini, Italy]

So you've released a library! Now you need to maintain it. You want to add features, restructure the code, fix bugs, and maybe improve the library's usability. Your users just want their code to carry on working. That's okay!

This talk will cover techniques in both code and project management to allow you to keep your code moving forwards without breaking your users' code. It is aimed at developers with a little experience of writing libraries in Python, and will cover some intermediate subjects like function decorators and magic methods.

Refactoring in Python is a mixed bag - on the one hand you have powerful tools like the @property decorator, __dunder__ methods, and even metaclasses. On the other hand, because Python code has no concept of private or protected like some other languages, it can be difficult to know what your public interface even is.

I'll talk about how to identify your public interface, and make that clear to your users. I'll cover how to structure your tests so you know when you've broken your public interface. I'll discuss how to use some of Python's language features to trick your users into thinking your code hasn't changed at all (except for those brilliant new features you've just added!). And finally, I'll cover how you know it's time to break backwards compatibility and how to break it to your users.

https://github.com/pybind/pybind11
pybind11 is a lightweight header-only C++11 library that exposes C++ types to Python and vice versa and allows creating Python extension modules with minimum boilerplate by leveraging compile-time introspection and type inference. While this library's goals and some of the  syntax may be considered similar to Boost.Python, it has a much smaller footprint, is entirely self-contained, and offers additional features like direct support for NumPy arrays.

In this talk, we will look at how to write Python extension modules in C++ from scratch with pybind11, starting from simple bindings and building up to more complex examples that deal with iterators, STL data structures, NumPy types and Python callbacks. We will also touch upon some of the internal machinery of the library like the virtual call mechanism and reference counting.

PyPy is an alternative Python implementation whose JIT often gives seriously better performance than CPython.  Now PyPy supports, in beta version, two major new application domains: Python 3.x, and Numpy and the rest of the scientific stack.  These are each an important milestone for a subset of the Python community.


Thanks to a grant by Mozilla, """"PyPy3"""" now largely supports Python 3.5 with one or two extensions from Python 3.6.  Full support should be  very close.  (Note that PyPy2 will not disappear, if only because PyPy itself  is written in Python 2.7.)
Numpy and the major packages of the scientific stack are now starting to work well with PyPy (PyPy2 mostly, but also PyPy3).  This is thanks to progress in """"cpyext"""" emulating the CPython C API, as well as fixes to the packages in collaboration with the upstream developers.
We will also mention some more """"what's new in PyPy"""" topics from the last couple of years.

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-14 - Anfiteatro 2]
[Rimini, Italy]

Cython is not only an excellent and widely used tool to speed up computational Python code, it’s also a very smart way to talk to native code and libraries. The Cython compiler translates Python code to C or C++ code, and supports static type annotations to allow direct use of C/C++ data types and functions. You get the best of both worlds while working with Cython: Python like syntax with blazing fast C speed.

This talk/tutorial by a Python/Cython developer introduces Cython programming language and leads the participants all the way from their first Python extension to an efficient integration with native C. 
Topics covered will be:
1. Using the Cython compiler to build a native extension module
2. Cython development from Jupyter notebook
3. Mixing Python with static C types in the Cython language
4. Calling into native code from Cython code (Brief introduction)
5. Wrap up: A brief case study
Cyvlfeat: A Cython/Python wrapper for Computer Vision library, VLFeat.

Participants are expected to have a good understanding of the Python language, some basic knowledge about C or C++.  No deep C programming knowledge is required, nor is any prior knowledge needed about writing extension modules for the CPython runtime.

The talk presents results from my PhD project on models for transportation related pollution.

Pollution from personal transport in Cities is a big and growing problem. By monitoring the flow, and congestion in the transport system two goals can be achieved. First, the adherence to agreed limit values (or breaking said limits) can be followed and used to decrease health effects of local pollution hotspots. Secondly, monitoring of the total emission of climate forcing gases from transportation, is important for designing climate mitigation actions. 

Python is used in combination with other tools to convert sensor data from smartphones, into pollution concentrations in urban settings. To mitigate the lack of complete data coverage, the missing data is simulated by a traffic model, to locate congestion and model the traffic related pollution concentration.

Motivation - Matching data collections with the aim to augment and integrate the information for any available data point that lies in two or more of these collections, is a problem that nowadays arises often. Notable examples of such data points are scientific publications for which metadata and data are kept in various repositories, and users’ profiles, whose metadata and data exist in several social networks or platforms.

In our case, collections were as follows: (1) A large dump of compressed data files on s3 containing archives in the form of zips, tars, bzips and gzips, which were expected to contain published papers in the form of xmls and pdfs, amongst other files, and (2) A large store of xmls in the form of xmls, some of which are to be matched to Collection 1.

Problem Statement - The problems, then, are: (1) How to best unzip the compressed archives and extract the relevant files? (2) How to extract meta-information from the xml or pdf files? (3) How to match the meta-information from the two different collections? And all of these must be done in a big-data environment.

Presentation –

The presentation will describe the solution process and the use of python and Spark in the large-scale unzipping and extraction of files from archives, and how metadata was then extracted from the files to perform the matches on.

Most of us have broadband internet services at home. Sometimes it does not work well, and we visit speed test page and check internet speed for ourselves or call cable company to report the service failure. As a Python programmer, have you ever tried to automate the internet speed test on a regular basis? Have you ever thought about logging the data and analyzing the time series ?

In this talk, we will go through the whole process of data mining and knowledge discovery. Firstly we write a script to run speed test periodically and log the metric. Then we parse the log data and convert them into a time series and visualize the data for a certain period.

Next we conduct some data analysis; finding trends, forecasting, and detecting anomalous data. There will be several statistic or deep learning techniques used for the analysis; ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average), LSTM (Long Short Term Memory).

The goal is to provide basic idea how to run speed test and collect metrics by automated script in Python. Also, I will provide high level concept of the methodologies for analyzing time series data. Also, I would like to motivate Python people to try this at home.

This session is designed to be accessible to everyone, including anyone with no expertise in mathematics, computer science. Understandings of basic concepts of machine learning and some Python tools bringing such concepts into practice might be helpful, but not necessary for the audience.

Thought up in 2009 by a group of MIT students who entered the Python bee into a competition for “bad ideas”, a Python bee is like a spelling bee for programmers. 

Instead of spelling words, participants are given functions to write and must spell them out loud - one character at a time, without looking at the code that they're writing! Players must spell valid Python and every character counts, including symbols and whitespace. 

And the twist for the second round (credit for this one goes to dropboxblogs):

You're now allowed to look at the code, but... you must now team up with other programmers, entering alternate characters without being allowed to communicate via any other means.

In order for everyone to be able to have a go, we'll split up into small groups to play - for those that want to be competitive, we'll use a scoring system so that we can still declare an overall champion. You're very welcome to come along just to have fun though!

TL;DR - a fun hour of slightly ridiculous programming games :)

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-14 - PyCharm Room]

Rethinking how we build HTTP APIs

The Python universe is overflowing with web frameworks, from full featured batteries included frameworks like Django to micro frameworks like Bottle or Flask. They each have their own specific features but in the end they are all very similar in their core functionality of processing requests and generating responses.

In this talk I will discuss why I felt the need to create yet another framework, a pico framework, that specifically focuses on the task of building HTTP based APIs for the web.

Pico, as it is aptly called, doesn't do templating, ORM, custom routing, authentication, validation, caching, or a million other things. Instead it helps you write clean APIs using simple functions and modules with minimal boilerplate. Pico is both opinionated and flexible in equal measures so you can focus on what matters; your API logic. Pico helps you to write code that that is simple to get started, trivial to test, and easy to maintain as your project grows.

APIs built with Pico are self describing so client code can automatically/dynamically be created. Pico includes both a Python &amp; Javascript client but it is also very simple to interact with your API with plain old cURL/Requests/jQuery/etc. It is just a HTTP API after all.

Having recently released Pico 2.0, this talk will outline the evolution of this framework over the past 7 years and discuss some lessons learnt along the way about building HTTP APIs and frameworks.

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-14 - PyCharm Room]
[Rimini, Italy]

One of the strengths of the Python programming language is the huge base of Open Source libraries. The PyPI (Python Package Index) repository provides currently 105,917 packages, many of them developed actively by contributors. 

This talk is a tour through various tools and practices, which help to keep your package in a good state for your users and make it easier for other developers to contribute. One can find these practices in projects of different size, such as Django (24,244  commits, 1,397 contributors) Pandas (15,005 commits, 754 contributors) and Faker (20 commits, 3 contributors).

Some things to consider when creating your own package:

using a Makefile for automatic testing, coverage analysis and environment setup.
structuring your .gitignore file.
using pyenv and .python-version for Python version management.
using tox to ascertain that code is working in different environments.
squashing different configuration files to a single setup.cfg file.
using EditorConfig and .editorconfig to automatically set project coding standards in the editor.

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-14 - PyCharm Room]
[Rimini, Italy]

High-energy particles accelerated by the Sun during Coronal Mass Ejections (CME) are a major concern for a manned mission to Mars. On Earth surface, these particles are shielded by the Earth magnetic field. In space and on the Martian surface, where such shielding is absent or much weaker, CME pose a radiation hazard to the health of astronauts. The development of tools to understand and forecast the interplanetary space weather is a requirement for future manned space missions in order to properly protect the astronauts from the radiation environment. A variety of methods are currently developed by the scientific community and a number of public tools for space weather monitoring and forecast is already available online.
We present a Python-based tool which takes advantage of two publicly accessible space weather web portals. Our software combines the forecast of CME and a real-time propagation model of energetic particles throughout the inner Solar System and the Martian atmosphere. It consistently recovers real-time relevant information and provides with days-to-hours forecasts for the radiation dose astronauts on Mars would be exposed to. The system raises an alert signal when the radiation dose exceeds the security levels defined by the main space agencies adopted as a reference.
Our tool is meant to be integrated in a virtual reality simulation of a human settlement on the surface of Mars (Mars City Project www.mars-city.org).

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-14 - PyCharm Room]
[Rimini, Italy]

Have you ever considered how many relationships you have in your virtual life? Every friend or page liked on Facebook, each connection in LinkedIn or Twitter account followed is a new relationship not only between two people, but also between their data. In Brazil only, we have 160 millions Facebook users. How can we represent and manipulate all these relationships? Graph Databases are storage systems that use graph structure (nodes and edges) to represent and store data in a semantic way.

This talk will begin approaching the challenge in representing relationships in Relational Databases and introducing a more friendly solution using graph. The definition of Graph Database, its pros and cons and some available tools (Neo4J, OrientDB and TitanDB) will be shown during the presentation, as well as how these tools can be integrated with Python.

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-14 - Arengo]
[Rimini, Italy]

Command execution time can become important in a number of applications. Commands executed in command-line completion need to execute in less then 100ms or users will perceive a delay. In Shell scripting one might want to execute commands repeatedly in a for loop and fast execution times makes this more feasible. 

Python is a very powerful language but has a much slower startup time compared to other interpreted languages like Perl, Lua and Bash. It can take up to 10 times longer to startup then some of these other languages.

MicroPython was written as a lean implementation of Python 3 with a small subset of the standard library mainly intended to run on microcontrollers. But it happily runs on Unix systems with excellent startup performance, making it an ideal candidate for implementing certain time sensitive commands.

This talk will:


Explain when achieving fast execution times matters and when it doesn’t.
Present two different approaches to measuring command execution time, one simple and the other more detailed and accurate.
Compare execution times of a simple set of scripts that add two numbers in an number of different interpreted languages (micropython, python3, awk, perl, lua, bash). 
Present an example use case of MicroPython on Unix. Bash completion for pip install that completes the names of available packages live from a remote pypi mirror.
Demonstrate the auto completion script with pip on a local pypi mirror.

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-14 - Arengo]
[Rimini, Italy]

In times of increased awareness of technical debts, reviewing and auditing code becomes more important. The main problem with code review is the amount of time that is being spent searching the needle in the haystack. You just don’t know what you are looking for and where to find it. One possible solution to the problem to the idea of bug prediction. If we could somehow know where bugs are in our code, focusing reviewing efforts on that area should, in theory, increase the effectiveness of our review. More bugs should be uncovered while less time is spent reviewing.
This is what Linespots tries to offer. It is an algorithm developed during my thesis that analyses a project’s history and calculates a probability value for each line of code in the project, representing the likeliness of a bug existing in that line.
Using the probabilities, reviewers can focus on the areas that are at a higher risk of containing bugs and spend less time on robust code.
The research done so far showed, that by analyzing 0.5% lines of code with the highest risk values in a project, an average of 50% of the bugs fixed in the next 150 commits were correctly predicted by Linespots. This is an improvement by factor 10 compared to Bugspots, an algorithm developed at Google, which Linespots is based upon.

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-14 - Arengo]
[Rimini, Italy]

When we write code, oftentimes things are not working as expected. We followed the tutorial and yet we got an error. We introduce a new feature but something else broke.

Having to deal with bugs is inevitable. Trying to """"debug"""" what happened or what caused the problem can be really frustrating and timewasting.

The aim of this talk is go give ways to think &amp; steps to take when we are faced with the process of debugging.

The language for the examples is going to be Python &amp; the tools used - from the python ecosystem.

The talk will be practical, with a lot of real-world examples.

The goal is to cover the following scenarios by showing different ways to approch the problem:

You followed a tutorial but it's not working. What to do?
You introduce new feature but things broke somewhere else in the project. What to do?
You are using a popular 3rd party library but something breaks. What to do?
A bug occurs and you have no idea what or who caused it. What to do?
You can't fix or find the bug. What now?
You want to generalize your debugging skills. How to do that?

We will be talking about critical changes, binary search, problem isolation, interactive debuggers, printing, testing, greping and other interesting things.

[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-14 - Arengo]
[Rimini, Italy]

Overview

Static analysis is a powerful technique for improving the quality of software. It allows you to find bugs in your Python code without any the need for any annotations. 

At lgtm.com we provide state-of-the-art static analysis for a number of languages including Python. Our Python analysis can find bugs without the annoyance of many false positives. We have already found bugs in the standard library, requests, numpy and many others.

In this talk I will briefly describe what static analysis is, how it can be useful to you, and then give an overview of the techniques we use.

Intended Audience

This talk is aimed at all Python developers, although I expect that those who have used pyflakes, pep8, pylint or mypy in the past will find it the most accessible.
I hope that this talk will inspire developers to start using static analysis tools (hopefully ours) and to produce better code as a result.
I will assume that the audience knows Python well, but knows little or nothing about static analysis.

Thats our mission at babylon. Leveraging the powers of AI, python and micro services we took a step towards that vision by building a medical chatbot that we shipped in November last year. In this talk I would like to share with you all the things we learnt in the process.

This talk is our story. Its a story that starts with an idea and meanders through the dark and dangerous land of things like Graph databases, machine learning and async programming in python. The story is far from over, but we have come to a point where we would like to reflect and share with the community all that we have learnt.

More specifically I will cover:
- Architecture decisions we made and why we made them
- lessons learnt doing async in python at scale
- testing chatbots
- clinical governance and safety (literally 2 sentences, I promise)
- The drawbacks of REST
- Why I am glad we did most of it in Python

And then of course some time for questions at the end :)

The Jupyter Notebook (formerly IPython Notebook) has been used to support learning in different scenarios, including taught courses, self-directed learning and reference material such as software documentation. People have used it to learn how to program, and to learn about diverse subjects where computer code is important to human understanding. The aim of this talk is to dive into where and how notebooks can be used most effectively for education.

I will first describe notebook-based learning material created by a variety of people for different purposes, deliberately taking a broad definition of ‘education’, along with my own experiences using notebooks to teach Software Carpentry sessions and conference tutorials. I’ll pull out both strengths and limitations of notebooks as an educational tool to explore how they can be used most effectively.

In the second part of the talk, I’ll talk about several extra software tools which can make the notebook more valuable in educational settings, including Jupyterhub, with which a teacher can provide notebook servers for a group of students, nbgrader, which allows notebooks to be used as assignments, and cite2c, which can insert academic citations into notebooks. I’ll also touch on commercial offerings integrating the notebook, such as SageMathCloud.

Passwords have formed the cornerstone of I.T. system authentication for decades, but recent high-profile breaches have underscored the risks of password-based authentication systems.

The good news is that we can replace passwords with other factors:

email-based authentication
one-time passwords (OTP)
hardware keys (Yubikeys/U2F, etc.)

These factors can be used independently or in conjunction with one another to provide vastly greater security than the traditional username-plus-password combination.

Attendees of this talk will walk away with a detailed understanding of:


why the traditional username-plus-password combination is failing us
why email-based authentication provides no less security
overview of one-time passwords and TOTP
how to store/retrieve OTP codes, including password manager support
state of hardware keys in general, and FIDO U2F standard in particular


Attendees will learn how to implement these multi-factor authentication methods in their own Python-based web applications, with primary focus on methods for integrating email-based authentication, one-time passwords, and U2F hardware keys into Django-based projects.

Python 3.6 was released in December of 2016 and it has a lot of new cool features. Some of them are quite easy for using: a developer can read, for example, about f-strings and they can start using them in their programs as soon as possible. But sometimes features are not so evident, and a new frame evaluation API is one of them.

The new frame evaluation API was introduced to CPython in PEP 523 and it allows to specify a per-interpreter function pointer to handle the evaluation of frames. It might not be evident how to use this new feature in everyday life, but it’s quite easy to understand how to build a fast debugger based on it.

In this talk we are going to explain how standard way of debugging in Python works and how a new frame evaluation API may be useful for creating the fast debugger. Also we will consider why such fast debugging was not possible in the previous versions of Python. If someone hasn’t made a final decision to move to Python 3.6 this talk will provide some new reasons to do it.

This talk is about dynamic class generation in python: the practice of
writing code that generates classes and their functionality at
runtime. It will use boto3, the AWS SDK for Python, as a basis to dive
into the basics, the benefits, and the drawbacks to dynamically
generating classes.

-----

This talk is about the concept of dynamic class generation in python.
The whole idea is writing code that generates classes and their
functionality at runtime. You now may be asking yourself, “That sounds
like a neat trick. Why would I ever generate my classes at runtime?”
Here are a few reasons why:

- It can decrease the physical size of your code.

- It can improve the workflow in adding new functionality.

- It can improve reliability of your code.

One example where the power of this concept has really been leveraged
is in boto3, the AWS SDK for Python. Dynamic class generation has
allowed boto3 to become heavily data driven such that most of its
classes and methods are generated based off JSON models representing
aspects of an AWS service’s API. For example, to add support for a new
AWS service API in boto3, just plop in a JSON file into the library
with no additional Python code required.

Using lessons and techniques drawn from developing boto3, this talk
will dive into the following topics related to dynamic class
generation:

- The basics of dynamic class generation such as how to effectively
dynamically generate classes.

- How to overcome some of the challenges of dynamic class generation.

- The tradeoffs in dynamically generating classes and discussion on
when it is appropriate.

By the end of this talk, the hope is that you will have a better
understanding of dynamic class generation and come away with helpful
ideas for your next big project."

How does the experienced python programmer fair when faced with
python's ""new"" way of doing async programming for the first time?

This talk details the different ways python provides for attacking the
problem of asynchronous programming and focuses on the best practices
for the future (as of python 3.4 and 3.5)

-----

How does the experienced python programmer fair when faced with
python's ""new"" way of doing async programing in for the first time?
Do we all know how and when to use Futures, yield from, asyncio,
coroutines, the async and await keywords, eventloops, and others?

A lot has changed in recent versions of Python when it comes to async
programming, concurrency, and parallelism. We still have very
different ways of approaching the problem in each version, but they
are finally (as of python 3.4/3.5) converging to a standard.

This talk explores, from the perspective of an experienced python
programmer with little to no experience in async programming, what the
""one obvious way"" to do async programming in Python is supposed to be.
It does so but analysing examples of different categories of async
problems we may want to solve and what the correct way to solve them
with the latest versions of Python would be (along with the trade offs
of different approaches).

The examples include generic CPU-bound problems, IO-bound problems,
and ""both-bound"" problems; along with common tasks as building a
simple server, scraping, deferring a web response, and traversing
graphs.

When useful, I compare the solutions with the approach we would take
in languages that have been design for- and are known to be good at
async programming like Javascript and Go."

Beginning programmers or Python beginners may find it overwhelming to
implement a machine learning algorithm. Increasingly machine learning
is becoming more applicable to many areas. This talk introduces key
concepts and ideas and uses Python to build a basic classifier - a
common type of machine learning problem. Providing some jargon to help
those that may be self-educated or currently learning

-----

Supervised learning, machine learning, classifiers, big data! What in
the world are all of these things? As a beginning programmer the
questions described as ""machine learning"" questions can be mystifying
at best.

In this talk I will define the scope of a machine learning problem,
identifying an email as ham or spam, from the perspective of a
beginner (non master of all things ""machine learning"") and show how
Python can help us simply learn how to classify a piece of email.

To begin we must ask, what is spam? How do I know it ""when I see it""?
From previous experience of course! We will provide human labeled
examples of spam to our model for it to understand the likelihood of
spam or ham. This approach, using examples and data we already know to
determine the most likely label for a new example, uses the Naive
Bayes classifier.

Our model will look at the words in the body of an email, finding the
frequency of words in both spam and ham emails and the frequency of
spam and ham. Once we know the prior likelihood of spam and what makes
something spam, we can try applying a label to a new example.

Through this exercise we will see at a basic level what types of
questions machine learning asks, learn to model ""learning"" with
Python, and understand how learning can be measured."

scenarios where data is available and needs some logic applied before
being presented as web application, possibly on a commercial basis.

The agenda of the presentation includes an introduction on SlapOS, as
a tool used to deploy a wide range of different services and an
introduction of Wendelin, as a tool in order to make out-of-core

After a short introduction, we progress to show the steps to deploy
SlapOS infrastructure and later to deploy Wendelin on the just
deployed SlapOS, including an use case which shows SlapOS deploying a
fluentd instance to ingest data to the Wendelin Database.

To conclude, we make a live demo with an Jupiter using out-of-core
python to handle wav files stored on Wendelin, and a second short demo
on handle computer resources consumption data.

Pygame is a powerful set of libraries for graphics, sound, input and
more. But it is just a library: each program needs to import and set
up the libraries, implement a game loop and load resources among
numerous other concerns. While seasoned Pythonistas have no trouble
with this, teachers told us that they found it difficult to teach with
Pygame. There is simply too much boilerplate involved, and getting
students to reproduce the boilerplate perfectly before useful lessons
can begin takes too much time out of a 40-minute lesson.

Pygame Zero is simple enough that a lesson can be broken down into
bitesize steps where meaningful progress can be made with just a
couple of lines of code at a time."

A modern application has a lot of passwords and keys floating around.
Encryptions keys, database passwords, and API credentials; often typed
in to text files and forgotten. Fortunately a new wave of tools are
emerging to help manage, update, and audit these secrets. Come learn
how to avoid being the next TechCrunch headline.

-----

Secrets come in many forms, passwords, keys, tokens. All crucial for
the operation of an application, but each dangerous in its own way. In
the past, many of us have pasted those secrets in to a text file and
moved on, but in a world of config automation and ephemeral
microservices these patterns are leaving our data at greater risk than
ever before.

New tools, products, and libraries are being released all the time to
try to cope with this massive rise in threats, both new and old-but-
ignored. This talk will cover the major types of secrets in a normal
web application, how to model their security properties, what tools
are best for each situation, and how to use them with major web
frameworks."

Kubernetes is the Google Borg inspired control plane for Docker
containers.  It has a great API but needs a load of HTTP client code
and JSON processing to use it from Python.  This talk introduces Kube,
a Python wrapper around the Kubernetes API that enables you to manage
your Kubernetes cluster in a pythonic way while avoiding any
Kubernetes API peculiarities.  Programmers and operations folk who are
interested in interacting with the Kubernetes API using Python.

-----

## Abstract
Docker has had a transformative influence on the way we deploy
software and Kubernetes, the Google Borg inspired control plane for
Docker-container- hosting-clusters, is gaining similar momentum.
Being able to easily interact with this technology from Python will
become an increasingly important capability in many organisations.
I'll discuss what the motivations behind writing Kube.  We'll dive
into Kube using the Python interactive interpreter, getting connected
to the API, and simple viewing and label update operations. Finally
I'll discuss more advanced resource management activities like Kube's
'watch' API capability.

## Objectives
Attendees will learn about the key concepts in getting resource
information out of their Kubernetes cluster using Kube.

## Outline
1. Setting the scene (3 minutes)
1. Other Python kubernetes wrappers (2 minutes)
1. Kubernetes concepts quick recap (5 minutes)
1. Dive into Kube in the Python interactive interpreter (10 minutes)
 * Outline prerequisites
 * The entry point - a Cluster instance
 * Views and Items - two important Kube concepts
 * Item meta data: labels and versions
1. More Kube features (5 minutes)
 * Creating and deleting resources
 * Using Kube's Watch API support
 * The cluster proxy attribute for when you need to get at the actual API.
1. Q&A (5 minutes)"

The itertools module is one of the cornerstones of advanced
programming in Python. This talk offers practical advice about
iterator algebra that can be put into practice immediately.
Discovering the itertools module means taking the veil from our eyes,
and once we use functions such as repeat(), takewhile(), dropwhile()
or product(), there is no return — it is impossible to come back to
the world of the mere mortals, where solutions are more complex and
need more memory.

-----

The itertools module is one of the cornerstones of advanced
programming in Python. Part of the standard library, it provides an
iterator algebra that allows us to elegantly chain abstractions,
enabling solutions that are both simpler and more memory efficient.

The goal of this talk is to offer practical advice and clear lessons
that can be immediately put into practice. Illustrating it with
numerous examples, attendees will leave having assimilated at least
several concepts that will improve their code undeniably and
irremediably. Emphasis will be on showing specific cases where a
traditional solution can be overhauled over and over with functions
from the itertools module.

Let’s say, for example, that we want to alternate indefinitely between
two values: -1 and 1. The novice would use a variable, updating its
value at each step, and the average user would maybe opt for an
endless generator. Both are worthy and honorable solutions, but they
pale before the mastery of the martial artist who only needs
itertools.cycle(). Because that is the nature of the itertools module:
once the veil falls from our eyes and we come across functions such as
repeat(), takewhile(), dropwhile() or product(), there is no return.
In this talk we will learn to identify when they can be used,
accomplishing with a single line of code what for the mere mortals
takes much more effort."

We all know Python strength does not rely on its performance and speed
when running programs. This plus the flexibility of it, can lead to
build real slow and bad quality software.

In this talk you will discover a set of useful tools for diagnosing
where the bottleneck is in your programs along with trips for quickly
realizing which is the most needed resource.

-----

Have you ever felt like your software is eating your resources and you
have no clue why? Have you reviewed all the lines, debugged and
printed everything but you still don't know what's wrong?

In this talk I will conduct a fast intro of a basic set of tools you
can use to diagnose your software's performance and then we will go
through a simple piece of code to show how those tools work and what
you can expect from them

This set of tools will include basic ones given by the OS itself like
`htop`, `lsof`, `ps` and more advanced ones that let you plot the
memory usage for given functions like `memory_profiler`, check CPU
usage and the call graph between functions like `cprofile` and
`kcachegrind` and others.

By the end of the talk, you should have an idea of which are the most
typical causes that can make your program slow and you will have a
list of tools to search for and identify the source of the problems."

Learn how to use the new async/await language feature to write
asynchronous code in Python and [Cython][1]. See how to benefit from
the excellent low-level features that Cython provides to speed up or
parallelise your code, interface natively with external C/C++ code,
and achieve better responsiveness and lower latency also in mostly I/O
bound applications.

[1]: http://cython.org/

-----

Python has recently seen a fresh development boost around asynchronous
applications, triggered by the addition of the asyncio library and the
new async/await language features in Python 3.5, but coming from a
world of well established tools like [Twisted][2] and [Tornado][3].
The [Cython][1] compiler, which compiles Python code to C, has
accompanied and influenced this development. It provides full language
support for async/await under all Python versions starting from 2.6,
as well as native interoperability with existing Python code and the
new Python coroutines in Python 3.5.

Benchmarks show that, while fully compatible, Cython compiled
coroutines perform about 2-3x better than the same code executed in
Python, but they additionally allow to interface natively with
external C/C++ code, release the GIL, do parallel computation, and
much more. All of this extends the applicable zone for asynchronous
applications dramatically and can lead to better responsiveness and
lower latency also for mostly I/O bound applications.

This joined talk by an async I/O expert and one of the Cython core
developers explains how to write code with async/await in Python and
Cython, and shows how to benefit from the excellent low-level features
that Cython provides on top of Python.

with PEP 492 in Python 3.5. We'll go through asynchronous context
managers and iteration protocols it introduces. I'll briefly explain
how the feature is implemented in CPython core.

Then we'll explore asyncio design. I'll briefly cover event loop,
policies, transports, protocols and streams abstractions. I'll explain
that event loops are pluggable, which really makes asyncio a universal
framework.

We'll cover libuv - a high performance networking library that drives
NodeJS. I'll highlight where it's similar to asyncio and how it's
different.

In the final part of the talk I'll explain how to make an asyncio
compatible event loop on top of libuv. I'll showcase Cython, which is

Take POSIX, add capability-based security, then remove anything that
conflicts. The result is CloudABI, available for BSD, Linux, OSX et
al.

A CloudABI process is incapable of any action that has a global impact
It can only affect the file descriptors you provide. As a result even
unknown binaries can safely be executed - without the need for
containers, virtual machines, or other sandboxes.

This talk will introduce CloudABI, how to use it with Python, the
benefits, and the trade-offs.

-----

[CloudABI](https://nuxi.nl/) is a new POSIX based computing environment that brings [capability-based security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security) to BSD, Linux, OSX et al.

Unlike traditional Unix, if a CloudABI process goes rogue it _cannot_
execute random binaries, or read arbitrary files. This is achieved by
removing `open()` & any other API able to acquire global resources.
Instead a CloudABI process must be granted _capabilities_ to specific
resources (e.g. directories, files, sockets) in the form of file
descriptors. If a process only has a descriptor for `/var/www` then
it's _incapable_ of affecting any file or folder outside that
directory.

This talk will

 - Review the security & reusability problems of Linux & Unix processes
 - Introduce capability-based security
 - Summarize the design of CloudABI - its benefits & trade-offs
 - Demonstrate how to write Python software for CloudABI & run it
 - Point out the pitfalls & gotchas to be aware of
 - Discuss the current & future status of CloudABI

CloudABI began life on FreeBSD. It also runs DragonFly BSD, NetBSD,
PC-BSD, Arch Linux, Debian, Ubuntu, & OS X. The API & ABI are kernel
agnostic - a CloudABI binary can run on any supported kernel. The
design is evolved from
[Capsicum](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/capsicum/), a
library that allows processes to drop access to undesired syscalls at
runtime. CloudABI applies this at build time to make testing & lock-
down easier."

Are we looking in the wrong direction for artificial intelligence and
machine learning?

I'll discuss an older but perhaps more satisfying approach, that has
been neglected in recent years.

It begins with questions in logic and language, and can be explored
using easy techniques. I'll use simple Python programs to explore
three key notions in this AI research: **loops**, **self-reference**
and **tangled hierarchies**, themselves directly reflected in
important programming concepts.

-----

In recent years, we've seen interesting and spectacular successes in
artificial intelligence and machine learning, made possible by leaps
in computing power and techniques able to harvest vast quantities of
data.

The results are uncanny. We see them everywhere, from the personal
assistants built into smartphones to the neural networks that do an
astounding job of recognising images. However, they're also
susceptible to the criticism that they represent not intelligence but
a mere simulation of it, and that producing a convincing simulacrum
has become more important than a genuine search for  intelligence or
learning.

At the same time, another, perhaps deeper, approach has become
neglected in recent decades, along with the questions it asks about
the nature of mind, intelligence and learning. This approach begins
with fundamental questions in logic and language, and can be explored
using some of the simplest programming techniques.

In this talk, I'll use simple Python programs to explore three key
notions in this strand of artificial intelligence research: *loops*,
*self-reference* and *tangled hierarchies*. The way these concepts
directly reflect important concepts in programming suggests that for
the programmer, this approach could be more interesting and
satisfying, and simply more **fun,** than using huge ontologies and
big data to create mere simulacra of intelligence.

The examples I use will be concrete and easy to understand, even for
novice programmers."

During my last CPython sprint, I started to contribute to the CPython code and I
wanted to understand the beast.

In this case, there is only one solution, trace the code from the beginning.
From the command line to the interpreter, we will take part to an adventure

* Overview of the structure of the project and the directories.
* From the Py_Main function to the interpreter.
* The used technics for the Lexer, Parser and the generation of the AST and of
course of the Bytecodes.
* We will see some bytecodes with the dis module.
* How does VM works, it's a stack machine.
* The interpreter and its main loop of the Virtual Machine.

The idea behind is just to show how CPython works for a new contributor to
CPython.

From the command line, we will learn that Python is a library and that we can
embed it in a C project. In fact we will see the Py_Main function to the ceval.c
file of the interpreter.

But there is no magic in the CPython code, we will travel in the lexer and the
parser of CPython, and why not, by the AST for one Python expression.

After the AST, we will visit the Compiler and the Bytecodes for the
interpreter.
Of course, we will learn there is the peepholer where some basic instructions
are optimised by the this component.

And of course, the interpreter, this virtual machine is really interesting for
the newbiew, because it's a big stack where the bytecodes are executed one by
one on the stack and the ceval.c file."

SaltStack is a thriving configuration management system written in
Python that leverages YAML and Jinja2 which, by now, probably needs no
introduction. This talk will explore Salt beyond the minimum required
setup, targeting developers/sysadmins already using Salt, and those
considering making the switch from other systems but wishing to dive
deeper first. Attendees should be familiar with configuration
management systems and practices, and comfortable using and reading
YAML and Jinja syntax.

-----

There is much more to Salt than the basics. This talk will go beyond
the minimum required setup and will take a look at Salt under the
hood, which will appeal not only to system administrators, but will
also be more interesting to developers and to the DevOps community in
general as the talk progresses. Topics include:

* Introduction and basics review (master/minions, matching, grains, pillar)
* Salt Mine
* Syndic node
* State modules vs. runner modules
* The Reactor
* The Event System
* Salt Beacons
* Salt API

Attendees should be familiar with configuration management systems and
practices, and also feel comfortable using and reading YAML and Jinja
syntax. This talk is targeted to developers or sysadmins already using
Salt, and to those who are considering switching to it from other
systems but wish to dive deeper before making that decision. After the
talk, attendees will have a better grasp of the more advanced
possibilities that Salt brings, and be ready to apply them to their
use cases."

Optimization in Python (also known as mathematical programming) can be
performed by minimization (or maximization) of an objective function
within a model that can include discrete variables subject to a set of
constrains. At this talk, chemical engineering students of the
University of Alicante will introduce the audience to the
possibilities of optimization, presenting Pyomo and showing real world
examples such as how to improve your diet and save money at fast food
restaurants.

-----

Process optimization in industry has become essential in order to
maximize the resources available and reduce energy consumption.
Optimization problems become interesting when dealing with
restrictions (linear or nonlinear) and integer variables (modeling the
discrete decisions). Python ecosystem presents different libraries to
solve optimization problems, some of them are CVXOpt, CVXPy, PulP,
OpenOpt, or Pyomo.
Among them, Pyomo results interesting because:

- It can be used for Mathematical modeling in Python similarly to AMPL
(and GAMS)
- It communicates with the main solvers used in this field such as
GLPK, Gurobi, CPLEX, CBC and PICO
- It's free and open source Python library (BSD license), being
developed by Sandia National Laboratories, USA.
- It supports Python 3 and it is easy to install.

The talk will be divided in three parts:

1. _Introduction to Mathematical Programming/Optimization (15 min):_
visual introduction to optimization concepts including restrictions
and non linearties (linear Programming, Nonlinear Programming, ILP,
MIP, MINLP).

2. _Introduction to the Pyomo sintax and a quick note for the
installation (20 min):_ showing how to improve their diet and save
money when ordering food in fast food restaurants.

3. _Optimization problems in engineering (10 min):_ showing more
advanced optimization examples that include decision variables."

Computers are never as convenient as when they work for us. If you
agree with this motto, then Ansible, a deployment and automation tool
written in Python, might come in handy.

At Ableton, Ansible is involved in every aspect of deployment and
automation. From local machine setup, to vm creation and deployment in
our self-hosted datacenter, to our services in the immensity of the
cloud.

Because it is dead simple to use, can deal with any number of hosts in
parallel and has robust compatibility with Unix as well as Windows
systems, you will probably never have to write a shell script again.

Because it is written in Python and exposes a clean, extensible and
easy to adapt design and architecture; contributing features to the
project and fixing the bugs you might encounter during the journey is
extremely easy.

with details on simple circuit breakers as well as understanding how
they can be adapted for more complex situations. We’ll also discuss
some options for how to implement your circuit breaker in readable
python.


**Contrived FAQ time!**

**I don’t know what Circuit Breakers are, should I come?**
Definitely! We’re going to start from scratch and work our way up.
Only requirement is basic familiarity with backend services receiving
and making HTTP requests.

**I totally know what Circuit Breakers are, should I come?**
Definitely! After the intro, the main meat of the talk will be working
through a series of more advanced situations and talking about how we
can alter the basic circuit breaker setup to address them.

**I want real-world advice, not made up hypotheticals!**

As Armin Ronacher pointed out in a recent blog post, there is more to
Python's regular expression module than meets the eye. His post made
me wonder what other “hidden gems” are stashed away in Python’s `re`.
In the talk I share what I’ve learned about the inner workings of this
extremely popular and heavily used module.

-----

Anyone who has used Python to search text for substring patterns has
at least heard of the regular expression module. Many of us use it
extensively for parsers and lexers, extracting information .
And yet we know surprisingly little about its inner workings, as Armin
Ronacher demonstrated in his recent blog post, “Python's Hidden
Regular Expression Gems”. Inspired by this, I want to dive deeper into
Python’s `re` module and share what I find with folks at EuroPython.
My goal is that at the end of the day most of us walk away from this
talk with a better understanding of this extremely useful module.

Here are a few examples of the kinds of things I would like to cover:

 - A clear presentation of `re`’s overall structure.
 - What actually happens behind the scenes when you “compile” a
regular expression with `re.compile`?
 - What are the speed implications of using a callable as the
replacement argument to `re.sub`?
 - re.MatchObject interface: `group` vs. `groups` vs `groupdict`

To keep the talk entertaining as well as educational I plan to pepper
it with whatever interesting and/or funny trivia I find about the
module’s history and structure.

Prerequisites:
If you've ever used the `re` module, you should be fine :)"

When designing an abstraction for a complex system (an ORM-like
library in our case) you face a lot of design decisions and
challenges. This talk details how we chose to tackle those when
designing elasticsearch-dsl.

-----

The json query language for elasticsearch, as well as its other APIs,
can be very daunting to new users and can be a bit cumbersome when
working with python. That is why we created elasticsearch-dsl - a sort
of ORM for elasticsearch.

We will go through the design philosophy and obstacles found during
the development - trying to make a more pythonic interface for
elasticsearch while maintaining access to all of the features of the
underlying query language.

The focus of the talk is more on the library and interface design than
on elasticsearch and its query language itself, that is used only to
demonstrate the principles."

I'll go over the following points (the short list):

- I'll show how you can avoid math by simulating; I'll calculate the
probability that two people in the live room have the same birthday.
- I'll show how simulation can help you get better at many games. I'll
start with simple card games and with the game of roulette. Most
prominently I'll discuss how to determine the value of buying an asset
in the game of monopoly (See blogpost: http://koaning.io/monopoly-

- I'll demonstrate how you can simulate Red Hot Chilli Pepper lyrics.
Or any other band. Or legalese.
- I'll demonstrate the results of a scraping exercise which helped me
to determine the value of investing in Lego Minifigures (See blogpost:
http://koaning.io/lego-minifigs-stochastics-profit.html).

Depending on the level of the audience I might also discuss how biased
simulation can help you solve optimisation problems or even introduce
bayesian statistics via sampling. I'll gladly leave this decision to

Presentation on how you can write faster Python in your daily work. I
will briefly explain ways of profiling the code, discuss different
code structures and show how they can be improved. You will see what
is the fastest way to remove duplicates from a list, what is faster
than a _for_ loop or how “asking for permission” is slower than
“begging for forgiveness”.

-----

Did you know that Python preallocates integers from -5 to 257 ?
Reusing them 1000 times, instead of allocating memory for a bigger
integer, can save you a couple of milliseconds of code’s execution
time. If you want to learn more about this kind of optimizations then,
… well, probably this presentation is not for you :) Instead of going
into such small details, I will talk about more _""sane""_ ideas for
writing faster code.

After a very brief overview of how to optimize Python code (rule 1:
don’t do this, rule 2: don’t do this yet, rule 3: ok, but what if I
really want to do this ?), I will show simple and fast ways of
measuring the execution time and finally, discuss examples of how some
code structures could be improved.

You will see:

 - What is the fastest way of removing duplicates from a list

 - How much faster your code is when you reuse the built-in functions
instead of trying to reinvent the wheel

 - What is faster than the good ol’ _for_ loop

 - If the lookup is faster in a list or a set (and when it makes sense
to use each)

 - How the “It's better to beg for forgiveness than to ask for
permission” rule works in practice

I will NOT go into details of _""serious""_ optimization, like using
different Python implementation or rewriting critical code in C, etc."

`conda` can be combined with `pip`  to use all PyPi packages. Its
cross-platform and multi-languages features combined with power
environments can help to improve your productivity.

-----

The BSD license `conda` is a package installer for Python and other languages.
While it originates form the scientific Python community, it can be
really useful for
all Python programmers.

Installation of Python packages has become much simpler over the last years.
The use of  `pip`  and `virtualenv` simplify the installation of
Python packages a lot.
However,  they are specific to Python.  The Python-agnostic `conda`
has advantages
for packages with C or Fortran extension that are very common for
scientific libraries.
`conda` is cross-platform. According to different statistics,  the
most Python users work on Windows. Often is especially complicate to
get extensions with many dependencies installer on this platform.
`conda` facilities the installation for Windows considerably.

This talk introduces the basic usage of  `conda` to install packages.
This includes the basic commands for searching  and installing of
packages. Furthermore, the talk demonstrates the creation of
environments for different Python versions and combinations of
packages.

The building of a packages is simple. The talk shows how to build
recipes that contain declarations of dependencies .

`conda` can work together  with `pip`. This allows to use all packages
from the Python Package Index ( PyPI). The talk explains the concept
of channels that allow to get packages from different sources."

  - Why do code reviews
  - What are we aiming to get out of it
- Submitting code for review
  - How can you help reviewers?
  - What should you avoid doing?
  - Removing ownership of the code
- Reviewing code
  - How should you give feedback?
  - What should you look for?
  - How can you encourage people to review more?
  - How to avoid and remove bike-shedding
- Code review tools and how they impact on the process.

Query Embeddings is an unsupervised deep learning based system, built
using Python and open source libraries (Annoy, keyvi etc.) which
recognizes similarity between queries and their vector
representations, for a web scale search engine integrated within Cliqz
browser [https://cliqz.com/en]. It improves recall for previously
unseen queries and is one of the many key components of our search
stack. The framework be utilized by other low latency systems
involving vector representations.

-----

A web search engine allows a user to type few words of query and it
presents list of potential relevant results within fraction of a
second. Traditionally, keywords in the user query were fuzzy-matched
in realtime with the keywords within different pages of the index and
they didn't really focus on understanding meaning of query. Recently,
Deep Learning + NLP techniques try to _represent sentences or
documents as fixed dimensional vectors in high dimensional space_.
These special vectors inherit semantics of the document.

Query embeddings is an unsupervised deep learning based system, built
using Python, Word2Vec, Annoy and Keyvi (https://github.com/cliqz-
oss/keyvi) which recognizes similarity between queries and their
vectors  for a web scale search engine within Cliqz browser.
(https://cliqz.com/en)

![][1]

The goal is to describe how query embeddings contribute to our
existing python search stack at scale and latency issues prevailing in
real time search system.  Also is a preview of separate vector index
for queries, utilized by retrieval system at runtime via ANNs to get
closest queries to user query, which is one of the many key components
of our search stack.

At Blue Yonder we use Airflow (https://github.com/airbnb/airflow), an
open source Python package from Airbnb to solve these problems. It can
be extended with new functionality by developing plugins in Python,
without the need to fork the repo. With Airflow, we define workflows
as directed acyclic graphs and get a shiny UI for free. Airflow comes
with some task operators which can be used out of the box to complete
certain tasks. For more specific cases, tasks can be developed by the
end user. Best of all: even the configuration is done completely in
Python!

The OpenGL api is one of the oldest (and most used) graphics library
in both the gaming and simulations world. In latest years the api has
been extremely re-designed to support modern hardware features
available in GPUs.
Can we build realtime graphics application with Python using OpenGL ?
Well, obviously Yes !

-----

The talk will introduce how  2D and 3D graphics works, which math is
required for mastering them and why strong hardware cooperation and
heavy optimizations have been required since the very beginning of
gaming development history.

Once the theory is ""almost"" clear, we can start talking about OpenGL,
which problems tries to solve and how it evolved in more than 20
years.

The last (and the biggest) part of the talk will show how to interface
Python with OpenGL, how to draw simple 2D sprites and how to load and
show 3D models using simple lighting models.

Warning: OpenGL shaders (the custom code you upload in the GPU) are
written in GLSL, a pseudo-c dialect, so expect a bit of lower-level
programming"

Continuous Delivery, DevOps, Lean - all those movements have one thing
in common: extending the process of software development along the
whole value stream, ultimately to the customer. This simple
requirement causes surprising serious difficulties on traditional
operations workflows. All of a sudden, a single manual ticket to the
operations team is a critical blocker in the delivery process.
Therefore all parts of the infrastructure, storage, databases,
identities, compute resources must be provided as a self service for
the developers in order to be able to achieve this goal. What one may
call ""the cloud"" (including self hosted ones like open stack) is such
a successful model not least because they offer exactly this ""ticket-
less"" self-service. But why should we wait for ""the cloud"" to offer
what we really need? We are python developers, we are hackers!

At the LEAP Encryption Access Project we aim to make secure
communications both easy to use and easy to provide.

We bring some tales (and some, hopefully, tools) from the quest for
user-friendly crypto software. How to make people love the email
experience in the 21st century, without risking their privacy. How to
encrypt data locally, sync it to servers that you can lose, and still
be sexy.

-----

Technologies that allow for privacy in the communications, allowing
the escape from the pervasive massive surveillance, have been there
for some years now, but yet its use by the general public is far from
widespread. The challenge, in our view, can be defined by one of
making usable crypto. Usable for the end user, usable for the sysadmin
and for the fellow application developer. In the quest for massive
adoption of encryption technologies, we've been forging several python
packages to solve different problems, always standing in the shoulders
of giants.
We bring some tales from the trenches to share, from our humble
experience trying to deploy clients and servers to provide Secured
Encrypted Internet Tunnels and Encrypted Email. This includes
interesting challenges dealing with key management, automatic and
secure software updates, and processing of email while using stock
cloud providers, while still being resistant to hostile environments.
We'll show a webmail email user agent based on this architecture, a
promising future for decentralization and privacy.
We'll also talk about how to store locally encrypted data, and will
present Soledad (Synchronization of Locally Encrypted Data Across
Devices). Soledad is a library with server and client components that
allows the development of different applications based on client-side,
end-to-end and cloud-syncable encryption of private data. We'll play
with some toy apps to showcase its features and potential."

My name is Erik Näslund - I’m the co-founder and Head of Engineering at Hotjar.

I'd love to share the lessons learned when scaling a SaaS web
application which grew much faster than any one us could have ever
expected.

Words like “big” and “popular” carry very little meaning, so let me
define how big Hotjar is right now using some numbers.

We onboard about 500 new users on a daily basis.
We process around 250 000 API requests every minute.
Our CDN delivers about 10 TB of data per day.
We have roughly 3 TB of data in our primary data store (PostgreSQL),
another 1 TB in our Elasticsearch cluster, and a LOT more on Amazon
S3.

These are the key things we wish we knew when we started. They would
have made our life so much easier!

 - Log and monitor from day one.
 - Have a way to profile your API calls.
 - Things will fail, be sure you know when they do.
 - Have a way to keep secrets.
 - Everything needs a limit (even if it's really big).
 -  Be wary of hitting data type limits.
 - Don't get too attached to a framework.
 - Choose components which allow language interoperability.
 - Horizontally scalable everything.
 - Plan for database downtime.
 - Features are a great way to test things out before launching them
to the public.
 - Have a way to share settings between back end and front end.
 - Have a way to enter maintenance mode.
 - Require different quality of code for different parts of your application."

When standard Python syntax doesn't cut it, apply metaclasses to make
it do what you want. Here I present our metaclass-based implementation
of a declarative GUI layout syntax to inspire ideas for what to do
when your goals don't fit the Python syntax.

-----

When overhauling the user interface of Autolabel's labeling printers,
we wanted a clean way to describe the layout of the settings widgets.
The structure we came up with was a declarative class layout that
leverages Python's metaclass concept to build the underlying GTK
widget structure.

I will present the implementation to hopefully inspire you to apply
metaclass techniques to problems that standard Python syntax can't
quite solve. If that fails, you will at least have a way to
declaratively construct GTK GUIs.

A short, non-exaustive, summary of concepts I will mention includes
metaclasses (obviously), class hierarchies, method resolution
order, super(), and anecdotes of dealing with GTK.

CPython's GIL means your Python code can only run on one CPU core at a
time. Can we remove it? Yes, we can... in fact we already have! But is
it worth the cost?

-----

CPython's ""Global Interpreter Lock"", or ""GIL"", was added in 1992. It
was an excellent design decision. But 24 years is a long time--today
it prevents Python from capitalizing on multiple CPUs. Many people
want us to remove the GIL.

It turns out, removing the GIL isn't actually that hard. In fact, I
already removed it, in my experimental ""gilectomy"" branch. But the GIL
is one reason CPython is so fast! The ""gilectomy"" makes CPython
shockingly slow.

This talk will discuss the history of the GIL, how the GIL helps make
CPython fast, how the ""gilectomy"" removed the GIL, and some ways we
might be able to make the ""gilectomy"" version fast enough to be
useful."

(https://ep2016.europython.eu//conference/talks/fat-python-a-new-static-optimizer-for-python-36)

The Python language is hard to optimize. Let's see how guards checked
at runtime allows to implement new optimizations without breaking the
Python semantic.

-----

(Almost) everything in Python is mutable which makes Python a language
very difficult to optimize. Most optimizations rely on assumptions,
for example that builtin functions are not replaced. Optimizing Python
requires a trigger to disable optimization when an assumption is no
more true. FAT Python exactly does that with guards checked at
runtime. For example, an optimization relying on the builtin len()
function is disabled when the function is replaced.

Guards allows to implement various optimizations. Examples: loop
unrolling (duplicate the loop body), constant folding (propagates
constants), copy builtins to constants, remove unused local variables,
etc.

FAT Python implements guards and an optimizer rewriting the Abstract
Syntax Tree (AST). The optimizer is implemented in Python so it's easy
to enhance it and implement new optimizations.

FAT Python uses a static optimizer, it is less powerful than a JIT
compiler like PyPy with tracing, but it was written to be integrated
into CPython.

I wrote 3 PEP (509, 510, 511) targeting Python 3.6. Some changes to
support FAT Python have already been merged into Python 3.6.

We will also see other pending patches to optimize CPython core, and
the bytecode project which allows to modify bytecode, it also includes
a peephole optimizer written in pure Python.

-----

When working with WebApplications it is common to rely on an asset
management pipeline to compile scripts, minify css or preprocess
images.

Most of the tools available today rely on JavaScript to perform those
steps and always forced Python developers to rely on NodeJS to have
grunt perform the pipeline tasks, coffee-script to compile their
CoffeeScript or lessc to build their css. This causes longer setup
times for projects newcomers, complex development environment, working
with two package managers and dependencies that you use once a week
but still need to be there.

The talk will showcase the DukPy project and focus on how it is
possible to build a pure python asset pipeline relying on DukPy to run
javascript tools and WebAssets framework to perform the most common
tasks that usually Nodejs and tools like Grunt handle for us, greatly
reducing the development environment complexity and making its setup
as simple as ‘pip install’.

Virtualenv is a great tool for the development environment but it's
definitely not suitable for every use case. Also, Docker is great for
running the application in production, but not everyone that use it in
production tried to use it in the development environment. Why not use
the same tool from the beginning of the project and until it hits the
production in a uniform stack of tooling? This talk will show use
cases of using Docker in the process of development as well.

-----

The process of developing using Python is very straightforward and
easy. Still, each and every developer has his own style of developing
and building his entire dev environment. Most of us use virtualenvs
which are reliable and comfortable to use. But there are some issues.
For instance, the repeatability and immutability of the built
environment are not guaranteed.

Virtualenv does a lot of work that targets the direction of somehow
isolated and independent environments. They are *almost* *fully*
repeatable. In any team, we can hear the notorious expression ""It
works for me!"".

For some time now, I am using Docker instead of virtualenv for
building custom and really-virtual environments that are entirely
isolated. The containers are immutable and consistent, so this
workflow guarantees repeatability.  Using such technique, not only
enables the user to have unique and immutable environments, it also
allows de developer to create full app architecture that can then be
tested and deployed as is. So the production version will be in
identical conditions as the one from the development environment.
These features are not provided by virtualenv at all.

The goal of this exercise is to try to use totally different tooling
for building the application from its first line of code until the
production."

One secret of Django's success is the quality of its documentation. As
well as being key to the quality of the code itself, it has helped
drive the development of Django as a community project, and even the
professional development of programmers who adopt Django.

I'll discuss how Django has achieved it, and how any project can
easily win the same benefits.

-----

Part of my job title is _Documentation Manager_. When I explain this
to a programmer outside the Python/Django community, the reaction can
be anything from bewilderment to a kind of mild horror. When I mention
it to a Python/Django programmer, the response is usually: _Oh, cool_.
In fact, one secret of Django's success is the quality of its
documentation, and everyone who uses Django is quick to note this.

The returns on Django's investment have been substantial, but some of
them are also surprising.
The documentation has clearly been key to the _quality of the code
itself_, but also (less obviously) to the _development of Django as a
community project_, and even the _professional development of
programmers_ who adopt Django.

The Processing project demonstrated that computer art can attract a
wider audience to programming. Python has a robust catalog of
libraries, including two interfaces to OpenGL. However, none of these
libraries replicate Processing’s simplicity when drawing to the
screen. I will present my solution to this problem: a re-
implementation of VPython’s visual module purely in python called
PygletHelper.

-----

Processing is a programming language originally developed by the MIT
media lab with the goal of allowing artists, educators, and many
others develop striking computer generated or assisted projects
without requiring deep knowledge of software engineering or computer
graphics. Like Processing, Python has become a favourite language of
users from diverse backgrounds, such as web development, education,
and science. Unlike Processing, python lacks a simple and easy to use
library for drawing shapes. Python’s existing libraries for scientific
computing and data analysis could be made even more awesome when
combined with a simple drawing library.

VPython contains a module called visual that established a simple API
and convention for drawing shapes, however it was written in C++,
prior to the development of pyglet, and thus is not entirely cross-
platform. In this talk, I will demonstrate my solution to this
problem: a re-implementation of visual purely in Python called
PygletHelper. Pyglet, an existing python library, provides a python
interface to OpenGL. PygletHelper is built on pyglet but obscures all
of the OpenGL calls, such that the user can draw simple geometric
shapes to the screen and animate them without needing to know about
computer graphics terminology, memory usage, or C data types.

I will also show some need visualizations of science and music in my
talk, as well as the graphical glitches encountered implementing the
library."

Web APIs that are easier to understand, develop, test and use, is a
popular subject. ""An API is only as good as its documentation"". We
decided to play with this proverb and leverage the power of
documentation. We propose to use the code documentation and the type
system to provide lots of free features: explorable APIs, better error
messages, automatic testing.

Python is perfect to explore code and documentation dynamically. We'll
demonstrate what we came up to and the lessons we've learned.

-----

'Rich' web APIs that are easier to understand, develop, test and use,
is a popular subject. There are a lot of new specification languages
(e.g. swagger, apiblueprint ...) and libraries (django-rest-framework,
drf ...) that provide features in this direction. Following the old
proverb ""An API is only as good as its documentation"", we decided to
play with these ideas and focus on leveraging the power of
documentation. We propose to use the code documentation and the type
system to provide:
 - browsable APIs, that are easy to interact with and visualize,
reducing the need to provide custom UIs
 -  verification of inputs/outputs along with precise error message if needed
 - automatic [de]-serialization of inputs/ouputs outside of the domain code
 - smart exception handling, e.g. exceptions that are not documented
are automatically converted into internal errors
 - automatic testing, e.g. input, output and result including
exceptions are tested ensuring the code works and the documentation is
up-to-date.


This use case is one of the rare situation where introspection is
desirable and unavoidable. And Python is a good language to
explore/exploit code and documentation dynamically. The perfect excuse
to spend some time on meta coding a first implementation while being
at work. We'll demonstrate what we came up to, the advantages and
limitations compared to other approaches. And we'll share the lessons
we learned from this experiment."

This talk covers the basics of what Object Orientation (OO) is really
about. It focusses on the problem OO is aimed at solving and shows
where the OO mechanisms of Python fit into this picture. This material
can serve as an introduction to OO for beginners, but also as a homing
signal for experienced programmers who are doubting whether they are
reaping the benefits OO promises.

-----

Object Orientation (OO) is often introduced in terms of how it is
implemented by a specific language. However, understanding the theory
underlying OO is not quite the same as understanding how OO concepts
are supported by a particular language. It is insightful to understand
the simple OO fundamentals and how these map to the particular
implementation provided by Python.

In this talk I will first explain the very basics of OO from a
language-neutral point of view with the aim of showing what OO can
offer you and to give a glimpse of the simple mathematical theory
underlying OO. I hope to give you enough information to help you
distinguish between better and worse designs and to detect whether
you’re using OO as it was intended. I will also very briefly show how
these fundamentals map to Python.

This talk is for anyone: whether you’re new at Object Orientation, or
a practitioner wondering whether OO is worth the effort you’ve spent
trying to use it."

Introducing  asynchronous calls from within an endpoint in a web app
can be desirable but hard to achieve.
This talk will explore different solutions for this (running Twisted
event loop, Co-Routines, Asyncio, …) and how well they play with the
different parallelization models of common WSGI web servers.

-----

In the more and more popular SOA paradigm, it’s common for services to
have to compose responses with resources from many different services.
Everyone’s first idea will probably be to call each service
synchronously with your favorite python HTTP library. This
unfortunately doesn’t scale well and tens of successive network calls
will make your endpoints painfully slow.

One solution is to parallelize these network calls. If you are already
using an asynchronous web app (such as Tornado or Twisted), more
asynchronous in your asynchronous shouldn’t be much of a challenge.
But if you chose not to dive into the madness of chained Deferred
calls, and used a standard prefork/threaded WSGI web server (such as
Gunicorn or uWSGI) to run your Django/Flask/Pyramid application, you
might find yourself wondering how to manage these asynchronous calls.

This talk will explore different solutions (running Twisted event
loop, Co-Routines, Asyncio, …) and how well they play with the

 - Thank you notes to all who have contributed to the fundraiser

-----

Pytest is a mature testing framework for Python that is developed by a
thriving and ever-growing community of volunteers. Following the
principle of ""no API is the best API"" it uses plain assert statements
and regular Python comparisons. Writing tests with pytest requires
little to no boilerplate code and powerful features allow easy
parametrization and intelligent test selection.

In this talk we will have an in-depth look at new features of pytest
3.0 and live demo possible use cases. We will also learn about
important bugfixes and other enhancements of the upcoming major
release. Backwards-incompatible changes will be addressed and changes
made to the documentation will be highlighted.

If you are already familiar with pytest, you will be happy to hear
about significant improvements of the fixture and hook system but also
what's in store for a better integration with tox, an important tool
that allows testing across different Python versions.

In June, 2016 more than 25 Pythonistas from around the globe gather in
Freiburg, Germany to work on the release and set the path for future
developments of the core framework. This is a big step forward for the
project made posssible by a fundraiser that reached 108% of it's
initial goal.

I will share our experiences from the developer sprint while they are
still fresh and explain why these events are incredibly important for

async/await is here, everybody can use it in Python 3.5.  It's great
and awesome, yet only a few understand it.  As a PEP 492 author, I'd
really like to have a chance to better explain the topic, show why
async/await is important and how it will affect Python. I'll also tell
a story on how I worked on the PEP -- starting from an idea that I
discussed with Guido on PyCon US 2015, and landing to CPython source
code one and a half moths later!

-----

The talk will start with a brief coverage of the story of asynchronous
programming in Python -- Twisted, Tornado, Stackless Python &
greenlets, eventlet, Tornado, asyncio & curio.  We've come a really
long road, and it's important to understand how we ended up with
async/await.

Then I'll go over asyncio and curio, showing async/await by example,
explaining that in reality it's a very easy to use language feature.
You don't need to know all the details to be able to successfully use
the new syntax, and even build new frameworks on top of it.

I'll then explain the async/await machinery in CPython, starting with
generators and 'yield' expression, showing what is 'yield from' and
finally, demonstrating how async/await is implemented in CPython.
This will ensure that those who want to invent some new crazy ways of
using async/await will have a starting point!

I'll end the talk with a story of how I came up with the idea.  How I
shared it with Guido van Rossum, Victor Stinner, and Andrew Svetlow.
How the first version of the PEP was born, and how we managed to push
it to Python 3.5 in under two months period.  The goal is to make
people understand that it's possible to change your programming
language -- in fact, Python, as any other programming language, wants
new features and capabilities to be relevant."

While microservices are rather commonly implemented using JSON over
HTTP this is merely an implementation choice.  This talk will cover
the reasons why you might want to choose ZeroMQ as communication
transport between your microservices instead.  It will show how ZeroMQ
is used from within Python and the common patterns which can simplify
the overal architecture while at the same time providing reliable and
low-latency communications between your services.

-----

Microservices is the popular term for the trend to build backend
architectures as a number of smaller independent processes.  As an
evolution from the Service Oriented Architecture the core aims are to
create independent services which are easy to operate and even replace
while all of them together compose into providing the business logic
required for your application.

While it is rather common for microservices to choose JSON over HTTP
to communicate with each other, this is purely an implementation
choice.  HTTP is a protocol using a strict request-response format,
this can become a little burdensome when needing to deal with
asynchronous requests and forces some architectural descisions to be
not as ideal as they could be.  ZeroMQ has more flexible communication
patterns allowing for easier mapping of real-life interactions between
services.  Coupled with an easy to use asynchronous user-level API and
very fast underlying communication on persistent TCP connections
ZeroMQ is a rather attractive transport to build your microservices
based applications in.

This talk will show how to use ZeroMQ within Python to build your
microservices.  It will show the benefits of ZeroMQ's asynchronous
API, common usage patterns and how to handle backpressure.
Furthermore different communication patterns will be explored and the
impact this has on how to simplify the overall architecture using
these patterns."

not particularly
suited in case data require any sort of internal

In this talk, the different data formats will be presented and
compared w.r.t. their
usage for scientific computations along with corresponding Python libraries.

-----

The *plain text* is one of the simplest yet most intuitive format in
which data could be stored.
It is easy to create, human and machine readable,
*storage-friendly* (i.e. highly compressible), and quite fast to process.
Textual data can also be easily *structured*; in fact to date the
CSV (*Comma Separated Values*) is the most common data format among
data scientists.

However, this format is not properly suited in case data require any
sort of internal
hierarchical structure, or if data are too big to fit in a single disk.

In these cases other formats must be considered, according to the
shape of data, and the
specific constraints imposed by the context.
These formats may leverage *general purpose* solutions, e.g. [No]SQL
databases, HDFS (Hadoop File System);
or may be specifically designed for scientific data, e.g. hdf5, ROOT, NetCDF.

In this talk, the strength and flaws of each solution will be
discussed, focusing on their usage for scientific computations. The
goal is to provide some practical guidelines for data scientists,
derived from the the comparison of the different Pythonic solutions
presented for the case study analysed. These will include
`xarray`,
`pyROOT` *vs* `rootpy`, `h5py` *vs* `PyTables`, `bcolz`, and `blaze`.

Is Python is the best language for scientific computation?
I would like to give a short introduction into AstroPy module. Finally

For ages people have been watching the sky, and tried to learn
something about all those mysterious lights. In ancient times,
scientist used mostly their naked eyes to watch what happened in the
night sky. Astronomy is one of the oldest fields in science.
Everything changed when Galileo invented his lunette. Thanks to thi,
we were able to proof Copernicus’ new model of the solar system with
the sun in the center.

The next big step in Astronomy was using computers. Where there are
computers and Astronomy, there is a place for programming. For many
years astronomers were mostly using Fortran and C/C++. Both are suited
to numeric computation and scientific computing. Since they are
structured programming language, that makes them very valuable for
science.

Over the past decade, Python has started to be used by more and more
people in astronomy. But is there a place in Astronomy for Python, as
it is not as fast as Fortran or C/C++? In Python there is a module
called AstroPy which helps astronomers in their work.

MatPlotLib is one of the most popular library use in astronomy. This
tool helps created very sophisticated plots and graphs.

Finally I would like talk about some research I did using Python. For
research, we decided to use AUTO. It is a hybrid of Fortran and
Python, to compute bifurcation points in mathematical models. In
Python we introduce mathematical model, ODE and initial parameters.
Fortran does all the computation."

I will describe a scientific application of python in the field of
Astrophysics and Cosmology. How the publicly available package Monte
Python is used to compare data from space satellite missions with
theoretical models that attempt to describe the evolution and content
of the Universe. The result is surprising, as it points towards a
Universe which is mainly dark.

-----

Python is widely used in Cosmology, which is the study of the Universe
and all forms of energy in it. A large amount of data has been
recently obtained through space satellite missions, such as Planck,
financed by ESA/NASA. Planck has observed the radiation emitted about
13 billion years ago (the Cosmic Microwave Background, CMB), which
gives us information on the content and space-time geometry of the
Universe. Many competitive theoretical models have been proposed that
aim at describing the evolution of the species contained in the
Universe: therefore, cosmologists need a method to identify which
theoretical model better fits the data. In order to compare data with
theoretical predictions, cosmologists use Bayesian statistics and
Monte Carlo simulations. Among the tools developed for the analysis,
the package ‘Monte Python’ is publicly available and uses python to
perform Monte Carlo simulations: this allows to determine the
theoretical model that maximizes the likelihood to obtain the observed
data. Such model is now the standard cosmological model and reveals a
Universe that is very different from what scientists had ever
expected. A Universe in which the atoms we are made of, constitute
only 5% of the total energy budget. The rest is the so-called ‘Dark
Universe’.

I will illustrate the story of how cosmologists used python to analyse
the data of the CMB and unveil the Dark Universe."

At Polyconseil, we build Paris electric car sharing service: Autolib'.
This system is based on many services developed using web
technologies, Django and our own libraries to handle business logic.

Packaging is already a difficult problem, deploying large Python
projects is even more difficult. When deploying on a live and user-
centric system like Autolib', you cannot rely on Pip and external PyPI
servers which might become unavailable and are beyond your control. In
the beginning we used classic Debian packaging: it was a maintenance
hell. It took hours to build our packages and update their metadata to
match our Python packages. So we switched to Docker.

Docker allows us to have a unique item that is deployed in production
systems: code updates are now atomic and deterministic! But before
deploying the Docker image, you need to build it. That's where Grocker
comes in.

Nowdays, Python is the language more used for developing tools within
the field of security. Many of the tools can be found today as port
scanner, vulnerability analysis, brute force attacks and hacking of
passwords are written in python. The goal of the talk would show the
tools available within the Python API and third-party modules  for
developing our own pentesting and security tools and finally show a
pentesting tool integrating some of the modules.

The main topics of the talk could include:

**1.Enter Python language as platform for developing security tools**

Introduction about the main libraries we can use for introducing in
development of security    tools such as socket and requests.

**2.Libraries for obtain servers information such as Shodan,
pygeocoder,pythonwhois**

Shodan is a search engine that lets you find specific computers
(routers, servers, etc.) and get information about ports and services
that are opened.

**3.Analysis and metadata extraction in Python for images and documents**

Show tools for scraping web data and obtain metadata information  in
documents and images

**4.Port scanning with tools like python-nmap**

With python-nmap module we can check ports open for a target ip or domain.

**5.Check vulnerabilities in FTP and SSH servers**

With libraries like ftplib and paramiko we can check if the server is
vulnerable to ftp and ssh anonymous connections."

engineering is so much more than that. Programmers can spend 5-6 hours
per week on code review, but doing that is almost ignored as a skill,
and instead it is often treated as a rote chore.

How many of us have seen poor reviews - those which upset people,
don't catch bugs or block important features being merged? This talk
explores the social and technical impacts of various code review
practices as well as helpful tooling. The goal is to provide a
structure to help improve how teams review code, and to introduce the
costs and benefits of code review to anyone unfamiliar with the
practice.

There are always trade-offs to be made - e.g. think how costly a
security flaw in this code could be to your organisation - perhaps
intense scrutiny is not necessary for prototypes soon to be thrown
away. It is useful to consider the  trade-offs in order to optimise
for a particular problem domain. Perhaps right now it is more
important to look for issues with maintainability, functionality or
performance.

I talk about how some fantastic code reviews from mentors, colleagues
and strangers have helped me become a better programmer and team
member, as well as occasions where code review has been detrimental by
slowing things down and causing arguments.

This is aimed at everyone from beginner to advanced programmers."

Python has been adding more and more async features to the language.
Starting with asyncio in python 3.4 and including the new async/await
keywords in python 3.5, it's difficult to understand how all these
pieces fit together.  More importantly, it's hard to envision how to
use these new language features in a real world application.  In this
talk we're going to move beyond the basic examples of TCP echo servers
and example servers that can add number together.  Instead I'll show
you a realistic asyncio application.  This application is a port of
redis, a popular data structure server, written in python using
asyncio.  In addition to basic topics such as handling simple redis
commands (GET, SET, APPEND, etc),  we'll look at notifications using
pub/sub, how to implement the MONITOR command, and persistence.  Come
learn how to apply the asyncio library to real world applications."

-----

You can read in The Project Jupyter web page that “Notebooks come
alive when interactive widgets are used”, but programming complex
applications that rely entirely on widgets may end up being a painful
and frustrating process. Shaolin is a new python project that aims to
provide a framework for building interactive complex dashboards.

Shaolin provides all the basic tools for building complex interactive
data analysis applications using the pydata ecosystem. Arbitrary code
can be embedded into a Dashboard -a class that works as a “black box”
that allows to easily define a GUI based on the ipywidgets package- to
process any data in any form and then let you interactively define how
to plot it using automatically generated widgets. Hierarchical
combinations of Dashboards can be arranged then to build more complex
applications.

The talk is divided in two sections. First one introduce the framework
and its main features:

 - Custom syntax for defining widgets in a simplified way.
 - Dashboards: Syntax rules and capabilities.
 - Combining Dashboards to build complex applications.
 - Interactive plot creation.
 - Integration with pydata.

Second section will show how this framework can be used to analyse
real data using Dashboards without writing any code. I will show how

OpenStack is an infrastructure stack mostly developed in Python. In
this talk, Thierry Carrez and Doug Hellmann, both Python Software
Foundation fellows and OpenStack Technical Committee members, will
look at the symbiotic relationship between OpenStack and Python.

-----

OpenStack is an open source stack that can be deployed on raw
computing resources to privately or publicly present Infrastructure as
a Service. It now consists of more than 4.5 million lines of code, 85%
of which is Python. In this talk, Thierry Carrez and Doug Hellmann,
both Python Software Foundation fellows and OpenStack Technical
Committee members, will look at the symbiotic relationship between
OpenStack and Python.

We'll go back in history and explain why OpenStack originally picked
Python as its main language 6 years ago, and explore what does Python
bring to OpenStack. We'll dive into examples of OpenStack pushing
Python libraries to their limits and exposing new bugs. We'll look
into the massive cloud-based continuous integration system that
OpenStack uses and explain how it exposes bugs in Python libraries in
the minutes after they are published to PyPI. We'll look into Python
libraries that were created by the OpenStack community and libraries
that the OpenStack community took over. Finally we'll expose a few
best practices that Python developers can follow to get the most of
this symbiotic relationship."

FBTFTP: facebook's opensource framework for creating dynamic TFTP
servers in Python3.

-----

TFTP was first standardized in '81 (same year I was born!) and one of
its primary uses is in the early stage of network booting. TFTP is
very simple to implement, and one of the reasons it is still in use is
that its small footprint allows engineers to fit the code into very
low resource, single board computers, system-on-a-chip implementations
and mainboard chipsets, in the case of modern hardware.

It is therefore a crucial protocol deployed in almost every data
center environment. It is used, together with DHCP, to chain load
Network Boot Programs (NBPs),  like Grub2 and iPXE. They allow
machines to bootstrap themselves and install operating systems off of
the network, downloading kernels and initrds via HTTP and starting
them up.

At Facebook, we have been using the standard in.tftpd daemon for
years, however, we started to reach its limitations.
Limitations that were partially due to our scale and the way TFTP was
deployed in our infrastructure, but also to the protocol
specifications based on requirements from the 80's.

To address those limitations we ended up writing our own framework for
creating dynamic TFTP servers in Python3, and we decided to open
source it.

I will take you thru the framework and the features it offers. I'll
discuss the specific problems that motivated us to create it. We will
look at practical examples of how touse it, along with a little code,
to build your own server that are tailored to your own infra needs."

My reason for discussing this openly is because once it is there you
do not only deal with the technical debt itself but also with the
interest you must pay. Comparing the two, probably the highest cost
that we see is with the interest.
 As our code base grows and our deadlines get tougher we tend to
forget about the cost our project will have to pay for every
functionality that we implement in a hurry, for which we “forget”
about tests or for which we write in a comment “this needs to be
refactored” or “this is a temporary solution. refactor later”.
What qualifies as debt? What qualifies as interest? How do we manage
it? At what levels in our projects can we see the debt and the
interest? Is it really unavoidable?"

Docker is a relatively new technology platform that helps teams

We'll learn:

 - How Docker works.
 - Main risks.
 - How create and maintain secure images.
 - How defend containers.
 - How delimit security risks in containers.
 - Best practices for running containers."

Python packaging has evolved since they very beginning of distutils in
1999. We'll take a look what Haskell community has been doing in their
playground and what they've done better or worse.

The talk is inspired by Peter Simons talk given at Nix conference:

  - Cabal file specification overview
  - Interesting Cabal features not seen in Python packaging
  - Lack of features (introduction into next section)
- Cabal hell
  - Quick overview of Haskell community frustration over Cabal tooling
- Stack tool overview
  - What problem Stack solves
  - How Stack works

Vmprof, a Python profiler, and see how it helps us find out why a
debugger can be slow. Once we find the culprit, we'll use Cython to
optimise things.

-----

Profile is the main way to find slow parts of your application, and
it's often the first approach to performance optimisation. While there
are quite a few profilers, many of them have limitations. In this talk
we're going to learn about the new statistical profiler for Python
called Vmprof that is actively being developed by the PyPy team. We'll
see how it is implemented and how to use it effectively. We will apply
it to an open source project, the Pydev.Debugger, a popular debugger
used in IDE's such as Pydev and PyCharm, and with the help of Cython
which we'll also dig into, we'll work on optimising the issues we
find.

Whether it's a Python debugger, a Web Application or any other kind of
Python development you're doing, you'll learn how to effectively
profile and resolve many performance issues."

Nowadays Python is the perfect environment for developing a real-time
automated trading tool. In this talk we will discuss the development
of: a general-purpose multiagent-system module using Pyro and ZeroMQ;
a platform, based on it, for developing automated trading strategies
using Numpy, Numba, Theano, etc.; and a GUI for visualizing real-time
market data using PyQtGraph and Qt.

-----

In OpenSistemas we have developed a general-purpose multi-agent system
which is written in pure Python: *osBrain*. Agents communicate with
each other using ZeroMQ, allowing the user to define different
communication patterns based on their needs.

Based on this multi-agent system, we have also developed a broker-
independent platform for real-time automated trading: *osMarkets*.
This platform implements specialized agents:

- **Feeder** is an agent which receives real-time data from the broker.
- **Router** is an agent which receives data from feeders. It manages
the historical data and distributes updates to all the subscribed
agents in the network.
- **Brain** is the most common agent. It receives data from router or
from other brains and processes them, sending the results to other
brains or sending orders to be executed. Brains can make use of many
useful packages avilable in the Python ecosystem: NumPy, SciPy, Numba,
Theano...
- **Trader** is an agent which is designed to interact with the
broker, just as the feeder, but to execute market orders.

![system](http://i.imgur.com/A9vsWee.png)

While it is still in its earliest stages, we are developing a tool for
real-time visualization of trading strategies using PyQtGraph. This
tool acts as an agent in the multi-agent system.

Have you ever wondered how Django models work? I'll present a story of
data structure transformation. I will talk about ideas from Django
models that I used and how I rediscovered descriptor API. I will talk
about printing, serializing, comparing data structures and some  other
examples, where descriptors excel at making declarative code easier to
write.

-----

I worked as a developer of a testing framework for a C++ server. The
framework tested binary protocol implemented by the server.

Most of the work  involved testers preparing test cases. The data
format was primitive structures -- hard to read and easy to break.
Field order and all the data had to be entered manually.

At the time, I have already seen the better world --  the models from
Django. Have you ever wondered how those work? Step by step, I used
the ideas from there to make the structures more friendly and on my
way I rediscovered descriptors.

I'll show in incremental steps, how:

 - used keyword arguments to lower signal to noise ratio,
 - order of definition for sorting the fields,
 - realized that `__call__` is used instead of assignment,
 - used `__setattribute__` as first step to extend primitive fields,
 - discovered that I'm actually reimplementing descriptors,

and how it lead me to:

  - implement printing in a way that is friendly to regression testing,
  - use diff library for less code and better results,
  - implement more readable validation.

I want to show how descriptors work in Python and how they enable
declarative style of programming. By the end of the talk I want you to
understand what is at the core of the magic behind field types used by
object relational mappers like Django."

This talk will teach you how Twisted or Tornado supplement asyncio,
how asyncio can/is integrated with these frameworks, and makes a case
for the continued development of new and existing selector-loop based
frameworks. It will also paint a picture of the future direction of
Twisted, why the original plan of asyncio as a standard API has not
come to complete fruition, and what can be done about it.

-----

Historically, there has been no “standard way” of doing asynchronous
I/O in Python. A variety of solutions, from using threads (WSGI),
processes (multiprocessing), green threads (gevent), or selector loops
(Tornado, Twisted) have all been used to similar degrees, but apart
from the (now deprecated) standard library asyncore/asynchat, Python
itself did not have a blessed option.

PEP 3156, or “the asyncio PEP”, introduced in Python 3.4, provides
this blessed option, choosing a standard selector loop approach (or
“reactor”, in Twisted parlance). The role of asyncio may seem muddled
in the eyes of developers new to asynchronous programming, or those
that may not understand the technical details of asyncio nor the
political environment in which it was created. This talk will teach
you how Twisted or Tornado supplement asyncio, how asyncio can/is
integrated with these frameworks, and makes a case for the continued
development of new and existing selector-loop based frameworks. It

“Dime con quien andas y te diré cómo eres” Este dicho es una de las
ideas más revolucionarias en  PLN. Podemos saber muchas cosas de una
palabra por su contexto. No es lo mismo un adorable gato que un gato
mecánico, pero por el contexto diferenciamos esta palabra polisémica.
Hasta ahora la mayor parte de los modelos representan una frase como
una bolsa de palabras. Por ejemplo, si queremos representar este
conjunto de frases: [“I love Python”, “I love NLP”, “Pyladies are
cool”] tenemos un vocabulario de siete palabras: [“I”, “love”,
“Python”, “NLP”, “Pyladies”, “are”, “cool”] esta representación crea
un vector de tamaño del vocabulario para cada frase, y pone a 1 si la
palabra aparece y a 0 en el caso contrario : [[1,1,1,0,0,0,0],
[1,1,0,1,0,0,],[0,0,0,0,1,1,1]] ¡Pero,se pierde el contexto y los
vectores pueden ser gigantes y con muchísimos 0s!
Recientemente, hemos encontrado una forma mucho mejor de representar
las palabras: La representación distribuida -word2vec, por ejemplo-
En esta charla exploramos esta representación y cómo aplicarla en
problemas de clasificación utilizando textos de redes sociales.

-----

Multi-core CPUs are abundant and utilizing them effectively requires
programmers to parallelize CPU-intensive code. To facilitate this, we
have developed EFL (Embedded Flexible Language), a deterministic
parallel programming tool.
The parallel parts of a program are written as EFL-blocks, which are
embedded into a sequential host language program. The sequential parts
of the program are written in the host language, outside the EFL
blocks.
EFL may be embedded in any host language by writing an appropriate EFL
pre-compiler. At the moment, we implemented two versions of the EFL
pre-compiler. Both pre-compilers translate EFL blocks into parallel
Python code - one of them generates parallel code based on Python's
Multiprocessing module, and the other one generates parallel code
based on the DTM/MPI4PY Python module.
We will present the principles upon which EFL is built. We will show
the implementation of Parallel Programming Design Patterns using EFL's
parallel programming constructs (such as parallel assignments,
parallel for-loops, etc.).  Using our two EFL pre-compilers we will
show their translation to Python parallel code according to the
Multiprocessing module as well as the DTM/MPI4PY module. The
differences between code versions produced by the EFL pre-compilers
will be discussed.

Join this talk to learn about the OpenStack Python SDK and how to
deploy your web app  step by step using different components in
OpenStack.

-----

How many times you heard about OpenStack and all the cool things it is
being used for? Most of the use cases are big players that need to
handle huge amounts of data and automate complex infrastructures. But
what about actually using it, for you as a developer, to deploy a
simple app? In my case, at least, that has not be an usual topic of
discussion when talking about OpenStack. In this talk I'll introduce
the OpenStack Python SDK, a project relatively new in the OpenStack
ecosystem, and show you step by step how to deploy your own web app
using different components in OpenStack."

Dutch startup MiniBrew intends to disrupt the beer market by
introducing an easy-to-use beer brewing machine controlled by a mobile
app and communicating with a Python backend. Users want real-time
insights in their brewing process, which presented some challenges in
terms of architectural design. In this talk Elements Interactive's
Chesco discusses best practices and pitfalls of the IoT architecture
of MiniBrew by diving into message queues, protocol buffers and full-
session logging.

-----

The number one alcoholic drink in the world is undoubtedly beer. With
the rise of craft beers, also homebrewing has become very popular in
recent years, although it is still a complex and expensive hobby.
Dutch startup MiniBrew intends to change that with their revolutionary
beer brewing machine, which is controlled by a mobile app and
communicates with a Python API backend.

In this talk Chesco will share his ideas and experiences in utilizing
Python in the backend architecture for the MiniBrew project he and his
team are working on at MiniBrew's development partner Elements
Interactive.

As many IoT projects, the ingredients for MiniBrew are a device with a
limited chipset and internet connection, a backend to store the data
acting as the mastermind and a mobile app to allow end users to
control the brewing process.

The fact that we want users to know in real-time how their beer
brewing process is doing presented some challenges which required us
to come up with a competitive architecture that would both give real-
time status updates and not saturate the server with continuous calls.

Chesco discusses best practices and pitfalls in designing and
developing IoT architecture by diving into the RabbitMQ message
broker, the MQTT protocol and protocol buffers. He will focus on the
REST API and CMS site written in Python, elaborating on high frequency
data in the apps, scalability, full-session logging and overcoming
common architectural challenges."

on the SQLAlchemy Core API and the Expression Language:

- **Database Abstraction**: Statements are generated properly for different
  database vendor and type without you having to think about it.

- **Security**: Database input is escaped and sanitized prior to beeing commited
  to the database. This prevents against common SQL injection attacks.

- **Composability and Reuse**: Common building blocks of queries are expressed
  as SQLAlchemy selectables and can be reuesd in other queries.

- **Testability**: SQLAlchemy allows you to perform functional tests
against a database
  or mock out queries and connections.

- **Reflection**: Reflection is a technique that allows you to generate a
  SQLAlchemy repesentation from an existing database. You can reflect tables,
  views, indexes, and foreign keys.

As a result of the usage of SQLAlchemy in Blue Yonder, we have implemented and
open sourced a SQLAlchemy dialect for the in memory, column-oriented database

Do you ever wonder how your Python code looks to the interpreter? What
those `.pyc` files are? Why one program outperforms another, even if
the code is similar? Then let’s dive into Python bytecode! Bytecode is
the ""intermediate language"" that expresses your source code as machine
instructions the interpreter can understand. In this talk we’ll see
what role it plays in executing Python programs, learn to read it with
the `dis` module, and analyze it to better understand a program’s
performance.

-----

Do you ever wonder what your simple, beautiful Python code looks like
to the interpreter? Are you starting to get curious about those `.pyc`
files that always pop up in your project, and you always ignore? Would
you like to start investigating your Python code's performance, and
learn why some programs you write run faster than others, even if the
code looks more or less the same? Have you simply fallen so completely
in love with Python that you're ready to peer deep inside its soul?

If you, like me, answered ""yes"" to any of these questions, join me in
an illuminating adventure into the world of Python bytecode! Bytecode
is the ""intermediate language"" that expresses your Python source code
as machine instructions the interpreter (specifically CPython, the
""standard"" interpreter) can understand. Together we'll investigate
what that means, and what role bytecode plays in the execution of a
Python program. We'll discover how we simple humans can read this
machine language using the `dis` module, and inspect the bytecode for
some simple programs. We'll learn the meaning of a few instructions
that often appear in our bytecode, and we'll find out how to learn the
rest. Finally, we'll use bytecode to understand why a piece of Python
code runs faster if we put it inside of a function.

When you go home, you'll be able to use bytecode to get a deeper
understanding of your Python code and its performance. The adventure
simply starts here; where it ends is up to you!"

System tests are an invaluable tool for verifying correctness of large
scale online services. This talk will discuss best practices and
tooling (pytest and docker-py) for writing maintainable system tests.

Demonware has used System tests to verify online services for some of
the biggest AAA video game launches as well as internal operational
tools.

Many folks who write software are familiar with unit testing, but far
fewer with system testing.

-----

System testing a microservice architecture is challenging. As we move
away from monolithic architectures, system testing becomes more
important but also more complicated.

In the video game industry, if a game doesn’t work properly
immediately after launch, it will heavily impact game success. We have
found system testing to be an important tool for pre launch testing of
game services and operational tools, to guarantee quality of these
services at launch.

We want to share with you best practices for system testing: when to
write system tests, what to test and what not to, and common pitfalls
to avoid. Using python’s pytest tool and docker-py for setting up
services and their dependencies has made it easier than ever to write
complex but maintainable system tests and we’ll share with you how
we’ve made use of them.

Developers (senior and junior) and ops folks can walk away from this

One of the biggest differences, in the Python community, in relation
to other communities, is its effort to improve diversity. There is
even a Diversity Statement at PSF: ""We have created this diversity
statement because we believe that a diverse Python community is
stronger and more vibrant. A diverse community where people treat each
other with respect has more potential contributors and more sources
for ideas."" The authors will share experiences on diversity obtained
from ten different countries: Namibia, UK, Japan, Brazil, Italy,

based on queues, surfing on the AWS Cloud.

-----

Our goal? To build an incremental image processing pipeline that
discards poor quality and duplicated images,  scaling the final images
to several sizes to optimise for mobile devices.

Among the challenges:

1. Ingest all the input images that partners provide us.
2. Detect and remove bad quality + duplicated images from reaching production.
3. Resize all the generated images to optimise for mobile devices.
4. Ensure the process scales and behaves in an incremental way.
5. Ensure the whole process fits in a time constrained window.

Among the tools we used? Pillow, ImageHash, Kombu and Boto."

This talk demonstrates a technique for developing RESTful APIs using
Flask and Flask-Restplus. These tools automate common API tasks such
as: validating input, serializing output, routing requests to methods,
and turning Python exceptions into HTTP responses.

The final API comes with a Swagger interactive UI, which documents all
endpoints and makes testing easy. The described tools tools provide
just enough syntactic sugar to make your code readable, scalable and
easy to maintain.

-----

Modern software is powered by APIs. User facing apps may run in the
browser or on mobile platforms, but they almost universally rely on
data stored in the cloud. More often then not apps use a RESTful API
to exchange data with the server.

In my talk I will demonstrate a technique for developing RESTful APIs
using the [Flask][1] micro-framework and [Flask-Restplus][2]. These
powerful tools automate most common tasks associated with API
development: validating input, serializing output, routing requests to
methods, and turning Python exceptions into machine-readable HTTP
responses.

A Flask-Restplus API is fully documented by [Swagger][3] which lists
all defined endpoints, their query parameters and the format of input
and output JSON objects. Swagger generates an [interactive UI][4] for
selecting options and easily testing queries. Flask and Flask-Restplus
provide just enough syntactic sugar to make your code readable,
scalable and easy to maintain.

My presentation will give an overview of the features of Flask and
Flask-Restplus; I will describe how easy it is to get started and
discuss some best practices for building complex APIs using this
approach. I will wrap up by briefly mentioning other components of the
Flask ecosystem, which give this micro-framework power to match fully-
loaded systems such as Django.

It is important to understand from the beginning how model API should look like.
Do not repeat your friends’ mistakes and make developers upset!
There are some simple rules that can make your API cooler - clean,
safe and efficient.

Based on both bad and good examples of REST APIs (I had to deal with)
we will learn about best practices.

-----

Nowadays building and integrating with Representational State Transfer
web services is a very common thing. It seems that creating RESTful
API is trivial - nothing could be more wrong.
In my previous projects I had to integrate with lots of APIs.
Unfortunately only some of them were easy to work with. Most of the
APIs did not follow the main rules of model API.

It is really important to understand how model REST API should look like.
To make developers happy we will learn best practices of creating REST
API from the beginning.

We will start with quick introduction what REST is, why principle of
REST is so amazing, talk about identifires and explain some key terms.
We will discuss about architectall constraints and properties.

Mistakes and best practices are based on my experience of developing
and maintaining the projects. After this talk you will be able to
create model RESTful API developers will be happy to work with."

Monkey-patching is a dynamic modification of a class or a module at runtime.

The Python gives developers a great opportunity to use monkey-patching
almost everywhere. But should developers do it? Is it a magic trick or
a powerful tool? In this talk we will try to give the answers to these
questions and try to figure out pros and cons of using monkey-
patching.

-----

First of all we will learn what is monkey-patching in Python and
consider some basic examples of using it.

Of course, monkey-patching may cause some problems in the code. We
will consider bad ways to use it and try to learn different types of
problems monkey-patching may lead to.

Despite of some bugs that may appear in a patched program, monkey-
patching is used in a real life rather often. There are some reasons
and motives to do it. We will consider the examples of using monkey-
patching in real projects like `gevent`, in some other libraries and
in testing. Also we will learn some monkey-patch tricks that helps to
solve real-life problems in the Python debugger which is a part of the
PyCharm and the PyDev.

After that we will compare using of monkey-patching in Python to using
it in an another dynamic language Ruby. Are there any differences
between them? Is our reasoning correct for Ruby?

Finally we will conclude all our thoughts and examples and try to give
the answer to the question from title."

To get real time insight into your running applications you need to
instrument them and collect metrics: count events, measure times,
expose numbers. Sadly this important aspect of development was a
patchwork of half-integrated solutions for years. Prometheus changed
that and this talk will walk you through instrumenting your apps and
servers, building dashboards, and monitoring using metrics.

-----

Metrics are highly superior to logging in regards of understanding the
past, presence, and future of your applications and systems.  They are
cheap to gather (just increment a number!) but setting up a metrics
system to collect and store them is a major task.

You may have heard of statsd, Riemann, Graphite, InfluxDB, or OpenTSB.
They all look promising but on a closer look it’s apparent that some
of those solutions are straight-out flawed and others are hard to
integrate with each other or even to get up and running.

Then came Prometheus and gave us independence of UDP, no complex math
in your application, multi-dimensional data by adding labels to values
(no more server names in your metric names!), baked in monitoring
capabilities, integration with many common systems, and official
clients for all major programming languages.  In short: a *unified*
way to gather, process, and present metrics.

This talk will:

1. explain why you want to collect metrics,
1. give an overview of the problems with existing solutions,
1. try to convince you that Prometheus may be what you’ve been waiting for,
1. teach how to impress your co-workers with beautiful graphs and
intelligent monitoring by putting a fully instrumented Python
application into production,
1. and finally give you pointers on how to migrate an existing metrics
infrastructure to Prometheus *or* how to integrate Prometheus therein."

If you have ever happened to need to deal with GPS data in Python you
may have felt a bit lost. There are many libraries at various states
of maturity and scope. Finding a place to start and to actually work
with the GPS data might not be as easy and obvious as you might expect
from other Python domains.
Inspired from my own experiences of dealing with GPS data in Python, I
want to give an overview of some useful libraries. From basic reading
and writing GPS tracks in the GPS Exchange Format with the help of
gpxpy to adding missing elevation information with srtm.py.
Additionally, I will cover mapping and visualising tracks on
OpenStreetmap with mplleaflet that even supports interactive plots in
a Jupyter notebook.
Besides the tooling, I will also demonstrate and explain common
algorithms like Douglas-Peucker to simplify a track and the famous
Kalman filters for smoothing. For both algorithms I will give an
intuition about how they work as well as their basic mathematical
concepts. Especially the Kalman filter that is used for all kinds of
sensor, not only GPS, has the reputation of being hard to understand.
Still, its concept is really easy and quite comprehensible as I will
also demonstrate by presenting an implementation in Python with the
help of Numpy and Scipy. My presentation will make heavy use of the
Jupyter notebook which is a wonderful tool perfectly suited for
experimenting and learning."

The LLVM Project provides an intermediate representation (LLVM-IR)
that can be compiled on many platforms. LLVM-IR is used by analytical
frameworks to achieve language and platform independence. What if we
could add Python to the long list of languages that can be translated
to LLVM-IR? This talk will go through the steps of wrestling Python
into LLVM-IR with a simple, static one-pass compiler.

-----

What is LLVM-IR?

The LLVM Compiler Infrastructure Project provides a transportable
intermediate representation (LLVM-IR) that can be compiled and linked
into multiple types of assembly code. What is great about LLVM-IR is
that you can take any language and distill it into a form that can be
run on many different machines. Once the code gets into IR it doesn’t
matter what platform it was originally written on, and it doesn’t
matter that Python can be slow. It doesn’t matter if you have weird
CPUs - if they’re supported by LLVM it will run.

What is Tupleware?

TupleWare is an analytical framework built at Brown University that
allows users to compile functions into distributed programs that are
automatically deployed. TupleWare is unique because it uses LLVM-IR to
be language and platform independent.

What is PyLLVM?

This is the heart of the talk. PyLLVM is a simple, easy to extend,
one-pass static compiler that takes in the subset of Python most
likely to be used by Tupleware. PyLLVM is based on an existing project
called py2llvm that was abandoned around 2011.

This talk will go through some basic compiler design and talk about
how some LLVM-IR features make our lives easier, and some much harder.
It will cover types, scoping, memory management, and other
implementation details. To conclude, it will compare PyLLVM to Numba,
a Python-to-LLVM compiler from Continuum Analytics and touch on what
the future has in store for PyLLVM."

We will demo and explain open source tech which allows the easy
scaling out across distributed devices. The audience will be able to

-----

Microservices offer an efficient way to only scale parts of your
applications which are hotspots. Instead of running multiple instances
of a monolithic application, with all the complexity and operational
run-time overhead that entails, you can scale only the functionality
which is a bottleneck. Today that increasingly means scaling out, not
up.

We will go over open source technologies which allow the easy scaling
out across distributed devices.

A live demo will allow the audience to participate with its devices
(including mobile phones) in an application. (There will be prizes for
the donors.)

The demo uses [Crossbar.io,][1] an open source router for the open
[Web Application Messaging Protocol (WAMP) ][2] written in Python.
WAMP supports routed Remote Procedure Calls, and Crossbar.io uses
these to implement various load-balancing strategies across endpoints
which register a particular procedure.

WAMP has a first-class library for Python ([Autobahn|Python][3]), but
is cross-language, with support for a total of 11 languages. This
allows you to implement polyglot and heterogenos microservices
applications, from Python to Node.js to C# right into the browser.
Microservices can run anywhere, since the outgoing connections to the
router which WAMP uses avoid NAT problems.

All software used is open source, and all demo code is provided on
GitHub under the MIT license.

A framework-agnostic approach to creating Python microservices with a
tests-first approach.
I'll show how to utilize Docker and Swagger to create service and
contract tests that run your service as an independent process, as if
it was running in production, giving you and your team a higher degree
of confidence when introducing changes.

A little bit of a broader microservice, TDD and work management
context will also be given.

-----

These will be my ideas on how to help a microservice-based (HTTP)
project by integrating testing into the development process (TDD).
I'll approach the testing pyramid presented in Martin Fowler's
""Microservice Testing"" as well as the test variants in ""Building
Microservices"" (O'Reilly) and I'll show a way of how they can be
translated to real-life Python.

The main focus will be on ""service tests"" (aka. out-of-process
component tests) and contract tests. They both can be run relatively
fast on a development machine and can give fast feedback to the
developer, preventing many kinds of problems.

Service tests run the whole application process without any internal
modifications, but have to present the service with a fake ""outside
world"". I'll show how to fake external HTTP services with Mountebank
(similar to WireMock). Instead of faking other systems (like
databases) we can quickly spin up the real deal as a Docker container
from within the tests.

Contract tests check if the contract (interface) of your service with
the outside world is kept, so no external services should be broken by
the changes you are introducing. It can also work the other way
around, proving that your collaborators are keeping their part of the
deal. In both cases, Swagger (a RESTful API description scheme) and a
few clever tricks can be used for significant advantage."

Having to deal with a monolith, an application which became far to big
over the time, can be quite bothersome. On the other hand if you split
it up and have to deal with lots of smaller components, you might end
up in dependency hell. But not only the splitting of the monolith and
the management of the dependencies afterwards can be a problem, but
also the packaging of you python components itself.

-----

Do you know this situation, where you and your team are facing this
big monolith? An application which has grown far too
big over the years. Every time when you make a change, you have to
fear the code might break at a totally different place, because lots
of things
are closely intertwined. But what to do if you are at such a point?
Maybe you start thinking about microservices but then questions like
""Are they really the right thing for us?"" and ""How do we get there?"" arise.

In my talk I will show you how we are dealing with our monolith. A
collection of multiple python packages without clear boundaries,
forming the
actual application - all living in a single monorepo.

I will talk about how we split up the whole thing, making it more
flexible for us and also easier to use individual components by other
teams.
All this, of course, comes with a price: You have to think more about
the dependencies between you components. You have to think about how
you can efficiently test everything, making sure your final
application is still working correctly.
Don't loosing yourself in dependency hell and packaging all components
correctly becomes quite a challenge.

This talk will:

 - show you bad patterns to avoid, so that you don't end up in the
above situation in the first place
 - give you ideas what to consider when tackling your monolith
 - explain how to package your python components and how to mange your
dependencies"

Ever wondered how Python works under the hood? One way to learn about
Python-the-C-program is by exploring the C API for writing Python
bindings to native C libraries. In this talk, we will walk through a
simple example of making a C library callable from Python code and
vice versa. Along the way, we will encounter some essential features
of Python: reference counting, memory management, and the inner-
workings of objects and modules.

-----

We all love Python. It’s so elegant and easy to use as a programming
language that we forget about the giant, complicated C program
executing our strings of white-space sensitive code. For many Python
programmers, this side of Python is just a big black box. It works
well, so thankfully we don’t *need* to go messing around inside... but
what if you *want* to look into the inner workings of this powerful
tool? One way to dive into the C-program-side of Python is by
exploring the C API for writing Python bindings to native C libraries.
In this talk I will explore the basics of this API as I recount my
journey to make a simple C library callable from Python code, and
allow C code to invoke objects defined in pure Python. Along the way,
we will encounter some essential features of Python: reference
counting, memory management, and the inner-workings of objects and
modules."

Research is financed from public money and researchers publish papers.
But, papers are often unavailable to everyone except if you pay money
for it, which seems wrong! What can we do as developers? Well, we can
help researchers to open their papers!

And of course, how do we do it?

Python, of course! Dissemin is a website using the Django framework
which aims to promote a global Open Access policy, it offers to
researchers a way to deposit legally their papers inside of a

Visual data exploration, e.g. of social networks, can be ugly manual
work. The talk will be an introduction for the combined usage of
NetworkX and Bokeh in a Jupyter Notebook to show how easy interactive
network visualization can be.

-----

During some work with social network analysis my favoured tool to
study the networks was NetworkX. It provides a wide set of features
and algorithms for network analysis, all in Python. But the
functionality to visualize networks is not very strong and not to
mention the missing interactive manipulation. However during the
exploration of data: exporting, feeding an extra tool for
visualization and then manipulating data manually was a tedious
workflow.

As I also had the optional target of presenting networks in a browser,
I improved this workflow by creating a Flask web application providing
interfaces to my networks. On the browser side I created a javascript
client based on D3.js. In retrospective the required programming
effort in Python and also in Javascript was too much for such a task.
And exactly this target, interactive visualization in a browser (and
as bonus in a Jupyter Notebook), can be achieved quiet easy now with
Bokeh.

The talk will be a step by step introduction, starting with the basic
visualization of a network using Bokeh, NetworkX and a Jupyter
Notebook. Next, how to create interactions with your network which
will be used to change a network structure, e.g. a leaving person. As
we want to see directly the impact of these changes in a network I
will finally show how to update networks and visualize directly how
the importance of the remaining people changes. And all this can be
achieved with Python and maybe a bit of Javascript.

migration strategies that were employed in the transition period and
how to live with a mixed environment of metadata in PostgreSQL and
data in an HDF5 file. I will also talk about concurrency, since the
underlying application is distributed and massively parallel, and
still it uses the purely sequential version of HDF5. Questions from
the audience are expected and welcome.
The talk is of interest to a large public, since it is mostly about
measuring things, monitoring and testing a legacy system,
making sure that the changes do not break the previous behavior
and keeping the users happy, while internally rewriting
all of the original code. And doing that in a small enough number of years!"

This talk is a case-study of how Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciKit-learn)
can be implemented to identify the influence of the potential drivers
of a decline in size of Atlantic herring populations using Gradient
Boosting Regression Trees.

-----

A decline in size and weight of Atlantic herring  in the Celtic Sea
has been observed since the mid-1980’s.  The cause of the decline
remains largely unexplained but is likely to be driven by the
interactive effect of various endogenous and exogenous factors. The
goal of this study is to interrogate a long time-series of biological
data obtained from commercial fisheries from 1959 to 2012.  We use
gradient boosting regression trees to identify important variables
underlying changes in growth from various potential drivers, such as:
- Atlantic multidecadal oscillation;
- sea surface temperature;
- salinity;
- wind;
- zooplankton abundance;
- fishing pressure.
This learning algorithm allows to quantify the influence of the
potential drivers of change with the test error lower when compared to
other supervised learning techniques. The predictor variables
importance spectrum (feature importance) helps to identify the
underlying patterns and potential tipping points while resolving the
external mechanisms underlying observed changes in size and weight of
herring.  This analysis is a useful case-study of how Python can be
implemented in academia.  The outputs of the analysis are of relevance
to conservation efforts and sustainable fisheries management which
promotes species resistance and resilience."

technique of several western programs ranging from  curing stress-

Mind is the root of all things. Neuroscience shows that attention is a
fundamental function of the mind. Being able to direct attention to
the present moment - and keep it there while performing daily tasks -
is a great tool to navigate through life and its  challenges with more
engagement, more happiness, and more resilience. Focusing attention in
a relaxed way enables us to disconnect from the overall noise found in
a high-speed environment and get things done without feeling too
overwhelmed by them. But being effective is not only about checking
off more tasks - it is about how we are in resonance with our
environment, how we interact with others, and how we face the
increasing complexity in our professional life.

it with [pytest-nodev](http://pytest-
nodev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html) an Open Source test-
driven search engine for Python code.

When developing new functionalities developers spend significant
efforts searching for code to reuse, mainly via keyword-based
searches, e.g. on StackOverflow and Google. Keyword-based search is
effective in finding code that is explicitly designed and documented
to be reused, e.g. libraries and frameworks, but typically fails to
identify reusable functions and classes in the large corpus of
auxiliary code of software projects.

TDR aims to address the limits of keyword-based search with test-
driven code search that focuses instead on code behaviour and
semantics. Developing a new feature in TDR starts with the developer
writing the tests that will validate candidate implementations of the
desired functionality. Before writing any functional code the tests
are run against all functions and classes of available projects. Any
code passing the tests is presented to the developer as a candidate
implementation for the target feature.

[Pytest-nodev](https://github.com/nodev-io/pytest-nodev) and other nodev tools that help implement TDR for Python are newer than the JAVA counterparts, in spite of that we will present several applications of the technique to more and more complex examples."

In Machine Learning, the power of combining many models have proven to
successfully provide better results than single models.

The primary goal of the talk is to answer the following questions:
1) Why and How ensembles produce better output?
2) When data scales, what's the impact? What are the trade-offs to consider?
3) Can ensemble models eliminate expert domain knowledge?

-----

It is relatively easy to build a first-cut machine learning model. But
what does it take to build a reasonably good model, or even a state-
of-art model ?

Ensemble models. They are our best friends. They help us exploit the
power of computing. Ensemble methods aren't new. They form the basis
for some extremely powerful machine learning algorithms like random
forests and gradient boosting machines. The key point about ensemble
is that consensus from diverse models are more reliable than a single
source. This talk will cover how we can combine model outputs from
various base models(logistic regression, support vector machines,
decision trees, neural networks, etc) to create a stronger/better
model output.

This talk will cover various strategies to create ensemble models.

Using third-party Python libraries along with scikit-learn, this talk
will demonstrate the following ensemble methodologies:
1) Bagging
2) Boosting
3) Stacking

Real-life examples from the enterprise world will be show-cased where
ensemble models produced better results consistently when compared
against single best-performing models.

There will also be emphasis on the following: Feature engineering,
model selection, importance of bias-variance and generalization.

Creating better models is the critical component of building a good
data science product.

Data science is a hot topic and  Python has emerged as an ideal language for it.
Its strength for data analysis come from the cultural mix between the
scientific Python community, and more conventional software usage,
such as web development or system administration. I'll show how and
why Python is a easy and powerful tool for data science.

-----

Python started as a scripting language, but now it is the new trend
everywhere and in particular for data science, the latest rage of
computing. It didn't get there by chance: tools and concepts built by
nerdy scientists and geek sysadmins provide foundations for what is
said to be the sexiest job: data scientist.

In my talk I'll give a personal perspective, historical and technical,
on the progress of the scientific Python ecosystem, from numerical
physics to data mining. What made Python suitable for science; How
could scipy grow to challenge commercial giants such as Matlab; Why
the cultural gap between scientific Python and the broader Python
community turned out to be a gold mine; How scikit-learn was born,
what technical decisions enabled it to grow; And last but not least,
how we are addressing a wider and wider public, lowering the bar and
empowering people.

The talk will discuss low-level technical aspects, such as how the
Python world makes it easy to move large chunks of number across code.
It will touch upon current exciting developments in scikit-learn and
joblib. But it will also talk about softer topics, such as project
dynamics or documentation, as software's success is determined by

In this talk, we will see an intro to CFFI, an alternative to using
the standard C API to extend Python.  CFFI works on CPython and on
PyPy.  It
is a possible solution to a problem that hits notably PyPy --- the
CPython C API.

The CPython C API was great and contributed to the present-day success
of Python, together with tools built on top of it like Cython and SWIG.
I will argue that it may be time to look beyond it, and present CFFI as
such an example.

-----

I will introduce CFFI, a way to call C libraries from Python.

    http://cffi.readthedocs.org/

CFFI was designed in 2012 to get away from Python's C extension modules,
which require hand-written CPython-specific C code.  CFFI is arguably
simpler to use: you call C from Python directly, instead of going
through an intermediate layer.  It is not tied to CPython's internals,
and works natively on two different Python implementations: CPython and
PyPy.  It could be ported to more implementations.

It is also a big success, according to the download statistics.  Some
high-visibility projects like Cryptography have switched to it.

Part of the motivation for developing CFFI is that it is a minimal layer
that allows direct access to C from Python, with no fixed intermediate C
API.  It shares ideas from Cython, ctypes, and LuaJIT's ffi, but the
non-dependence on any fixed C API is a central point.

It is a possible solution to a problem that hits notably PyPy --- the
CPython C API.  The CPython C API was great and, we can argue, it
contributed a lot to
the present-day success of Python, together with tools built on top of
it like Cython and SWIG.  However, it may be time to look
beyond it.  This talk will thus present CFFI as such an example.
This independence is what lets CFFI work equally well on CPython and
on PyPy (and be very fast on the latter thanks to the JIT compiler)."

A perspective of the impact of the PyconUK education track from the
point of view of teachers and educators.

Having attended the education track at Pycon UK 2014 as a teacher, my
talk will share both my experiences and those of other teachers
attending. The  education track bought educators and developers
together in a way that allowed the teachers to get support and advice
whilst developers   get to support teachers in developing exciting &
real applications for teaching computing.

The talk will focus on two aspects of the education track. The
workshops delivered for teachers by python developers and how this
helps build teachers confidence.  But also the breakout sessions where
educators and developers with common interests can work together to
develop something. This might be a program / library or a teaching
resource, some developers gave a hands on and bespoke training session
to a group of teachers.

If we are to get more young people programming or at least having  a
positive experience of programming then we need to minimize obstacles
to that experience. By having educators and developers working
together we can identify those obstacles and eliminate them!

Python is a language of choice for developers with wide range of
experience, for some it is a first programming language, others switch
to Python after years of experience. Python provides friendly syntax
and smooth learning curve. This sometimes leads to developers lacking
comprehension of some more advanced constructs.

It happens that experienced developers jump into using Python and
sometimes miss less known Python language constructs. On the other
hands people who purposefully learned Python sometimes lack practical
ideas for how to apply those constructs.

This talk will be specifically focused on the practical usages of
advanced Python constructs like iterators, generators, decorators and
context managers. Goal of the talk is to share ideas about how those
constructs can be used for practical purposes in real projects. Prior
knowledge is not required, there will be a brief introduction to every
construct being presented."

**Goal**: by the end of this talk, every developer should be confident
about creating his or her own custom mixins.

**Prerequisites:**
 - basic understanding of OOP principles and their application in Python
 - Django web framework

Generally mixins in Python are pretty straight-forward, easy to create
and use. Nevertheless a lot of developers stay away from them. I think
attendees of this talk will be interested to learn that mixins are not
that complex and their benefit is tremendous."

DEPOT ( http://depot.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ ) is a file storage
framework born from the experience on a project that saved a lot of
files on disk, until the day it went online and the customer system
engineering team decided to switch to Heroku, which doesn't support
storing files on disk.

The talk will cover the facets of a feature ""saving files"" which has
always been considered straightforward but that can become complex in
the era of cloud deployment and when infrastructure migration happens.

After exposing the major drawbacks and issues that big projects might
face on short and long terms with file storage the talk will introduce
DEPOT and how it tried to solve most of the issues while providing a
super-easy-to-use interface for developers. We will see how to use
DEPOT to provide attachments on SQLAlchemy or MongoDB and how to
handle problems like migration to a different storage backend and long
term evolution.

Like SQLAlchemy makes possible to switch your storage on the fly
without touching code, DEPOT aims at making so possible for files and
even use multiple different storages together."

be looking at the backend powering the new Yelp Business Owner Android

At the start, most of the development at Yelp occurred in a single,
monolithic web application, creatively named “yelp-main” (naming is
hard!). As the company grew, our developers were spending increasing
amounts of time trying to ship code. After recognizing this pain
point, we started experimenting with a service oriented architecture
to scale the development process, and so far it’s been a resounding
success. Over the course of the last three years, we’ve gone from
writing our first service to having over seventy production services.
Along the way, we’ve dabbled with Docker containers, Pyramid,
SQLAlchemy, uWSGI, gevent, and virtualenv in an effort to build the

When applications get deployed in enterprise environment or in large
organizations, they need to support user accounts and groups that are
managed externally, in existing directory services like FreeIPA or
Active Directory, or federated via protocols like SAML. While it is
possible to  add support for these individual setups and protocols
directly to application code or to Web frameworks or libraries, often
it is better to delegate the authentication and identity operations to
a frontend server and just assume that the application has to be able
to consume results of the external authentication and identity
lookups.

In this talk, we will look at Django Web framework and how with few
small changes to the framework and to the application we can extend
the functionality of existing RemoteUserMiddleware and
RemoteUserBackend to consume users coming from enterprise identity
management systems. We will focus on using proven OS-level components

web developers. In this mini-tutorial, I'll run through how to build a
data visualization in Bokeh and how to hook it into your web

built in d3.js.

Along the way, I'll provide tips and tricks that I've discovered in my
experience including how Bokeh works wonderfully with the iPython
notebook which I use to prototype my visualizations, and many data
science people use as their native way to explore data.

For those of you who already know a little Bokeh, I'll be covering the

whole concept of automated tests down.

Does it sound too good to be true? Python developers rightfully have a
suspecting attitude towards any tool which tries to be too clever
about their source code. Code completion and symbol searching doesn't
need to be 100% reliable but messing with the test suite execution? I

“Code shortening” is the “sport” where participants strive to achieve
the shortest possible source code that solves a programming problem by
exploiting all the tricks and quirks of the language.

The [SIZECON on SPOJ][1] is one of the oldest and most popular code
shortening problems on the web with a bizarre twist, only character
above ASCII value 32 are counted for the penalty. During the talk we
will take a journey into some frightening depths of the Python
language in order to write shorter and shorter solutions to SIZECON
until, exploiting a number of truly mind-blowing tricks, we will reach
the current record solution of 28 characters (above ASCII 32!).

I promise I’ll show you the most obfuscated, contrived and sick python
code you have ever seen and (hopefully!) will ever see. I invite
participants to give [SIZECON][1] a try and check their score against

[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]

Have you ever developed a nice, well-working python program on one
environment, only to have it blow up with exceptions and tracebacks
when you run it on a different environment? Have no fear! This talk
will show you how to write and maintain python code that is compatible
across environments that may differ by python versions and/or
operating systems.

Techniques and tips will be drawn from lessons and experiences gained
from making the AWS CLI, a python-based command line tool to manage
AWS resources, compatible across a wide range of environments. In a
case-study-like format, real-life compatibility issues encountered
while developing the AWS CLI will be presented along with how we
resolved each of them. These real-life examples will encompass, but
will not be limited to, the following topics:

• How to use functions and classes that may differ across python
versions and/or operating systems

• How to handle version-specific bugs

• How to handle strings, bytes, and Unicode across python versions

• How to handle differing locale settings

• How to handle file operations across operating systems

• How and when to vendor dependencies

• How to write tests that are compatible across python versions and
operating systems

• How to create a testing environment that monitors compatibility of
code across various environments

Ultimately, the goal of these examples is introduce to you some
effective, real-world programming practices to overcome your current
or next compatibility issue."

The past few years, we have made large strides to welcome more diverse
people into our community.  You see better gender ratios in attendance
numbers at Python conferences, the billed speakers, the amount of
women-centric programs.  We can see the benefits of outreach.  But
we're not done yet.

While a lot of the Python community embraces the importance of being
diverse, we haven't taken that mindset to our workplace.  From
recruiting, we still hear, ""sure, we wanted to recruit women, but we
couldn't find them"" and ""we only focus on quality here, not gender!""
Within company cultures, we hear ""gender equality isn't a problem
here!"" or ""women don't ask for a higher salary"" and to ""just lean in!""

This talk will recount the diversity efforts of the past few years and
quantify the effects on the Python community.  But this talk will also
address the not-so-low-hanging fruit; the  deeper-rooted problems that
still plague the community from inside where we work.  And it will
talk the audience through actionable items to improve one's work place

Do you deploy your Python services to Amazon EC2, or to Openstack, or
even to HP cloud, joyent or Azure? Do you want to - without being tied
into any one of them? What about local full stack deployments with lxc
or kvm containers?

Even if you're convinced you don't need ""the cloud"" because you manage
your own servers, amazing technologies like Private clouds and MaaS,
for dynamic server management on bare metal, may change your mind.

Fed up with the cloud hype? Let us rehabilitate the buzzword! (A bit anyway.)

A fully automated cloud deployment system is essential for rapid
scaling, but it's also invaluable for full stack testing on continuous
integration systems. Even better, your service deployment and
infrastructure can be managed with Python code? (Devops distilled)

Treat your servers as cattle not as pets, for service oriented
repeatable deployments on your choice of back-end. Learn how service
orchestration is a powerful new approach to deployment management, and
do it with Python! If any of this sounds interesting then Juju maybe
for you!

In this talk we'll see a demo deployment for a Django application and
related infrastructure. We'll be looking at the key benefits of cloud
deployments and how service orchestration is different from the
""machine provisioning"" approach of most existing cloud deployment
solutions."

Creating a large-scale event processing system can be a daunting task.
Especially if you want it “stupid simple” and wrapped around each
client’s needs. We built a straightforward solution for this using
Python 3 and other open-source tools.

Main issues to solve for a system that needs to be both performant and scalable:

 - handling a throughput of 1 million events per minute in a 4 cores
AWS instance;

 - following the principle of least astonishment;

 - data aggregation and how Python's standard libraries and data
structures can help;

 - failsafe and profiling mechanisms that can be applied to any Linux
service in production;

 - addressing unexpected behaviors of Python’s Standard Library; like
reading from a file while it is written;

 - tackling a sudden spectacular cloud instance failure;

The alternative to this system would be to adopt existing technology
stacks that might be too general, add more complexity, bloat, costs
and which need extensive work to solve your specific problem.
Moreover, our approach resulted in over 85% drop on hardware
utilisation.

Braintree is a Ruby shop. By default, we use Ruby and Rails for
projects. We also use Ruby-based projects for much of our tooling,
including puppet, capistrano, and rake. However, we strongly believe
in using the right tool for the job. What that means has evolved over
ti
me, and I'll discuss what solutions we chose in the past as well as
our current choices.

So what's it like doing Python at a Ruby shop? You get lots of jokes
about language features Ruby has but Python lacks and lots of
disbelief that Python will survive the 2/3 split. People also tend to
apply the best practices and conventions of Ruby to Python code as if
t
hey were the same. Python's major inroad at Braintree has been,
surprisingly enough, as a platform for high-concurrency situations.
This is a direct result of the power of Tornado as a platform for
asynchronous I/O. It also helps that many Python is very approachable
and
many developers have at least some experience with it.

Braintree has three pieces of our infrastructure using Python and
Tornado -- an incoming request proxy; an outgoing request proxy; and a
webook delivery service. They've served us well for 3+ years but all
suffer from a number of problems. The outdated concurrency feature
s of CPython / Python 2 as well as our lack of experience with and
commitment to Tornado have always been an issue. As the meat of the
talk, I'll speak in depth about the other issues we've encountered
with each of the three applications and our short- and long- term solu
tions to the problems.

The state as of the end of 2014 appeared dire for Python at Braintree.
All the old Python code in our stack is on the way out, and Python has
been specifically recommended agaist for new projects. Our Python
client library is used by some of our largest merchants, and is
ready for the future by supporting Python 2.6+ and Python 3.3+ in a
single codebase. We also have a vibrant Python community at Venmo, our
sister company. Both Braintree and Venmo support Python by attending,
hosting, sponsoring, and speaking at meetups, conferences, and
other events in Chicago, New York, and elsewhere. At Braintree, our
Data Science team uses Python almost exclusively and they're becoming
a bigger part of our business every day. We also use custom tooling
written in Python to manage our infrastructure."

[EuroPython 2015]

[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]

Finding a good structure for number-crunching code can be a problem,
this especially applies to routines preceding the core algorithms:
transformations such as data processing and cleanup, as well as
feature construction.

With such code, the programmer faces the problem, that their code
easily  turns into a sequence of highly interdependent operations,
which are hard to separate. It can be challenging to test, maintain
and reuse such ""Data Science Spaghetti code"".

Scikit-Learn offers a simple yet powerful interface for data science
algorithms: the estimator and composite classes (called meta-
estimators). By example, I show how clever usage of meta-estimators
can encapsulate elaborate machine learning models into a maintainable
tree of objects that is both handy to use and simple to test.

Looking at examples, I will show how this approach simplifies model
development, testing and validation and how this brings together best
practices from software engineering as well as data science.

The asyncio module introduced in Python 3.4 is a game-changer for I/O
management and event-driven network programming in Python. Aiming to
be a lower-level implementation of an asynchronous event loop, it
intends that higher level frameworks like Tornado, Twisted or Gevent
will build on top of it, taking advantage of the shared interface for
writing concurrent event-driven code across different Python
frameworks.

This talk connects theory with practice, presenting how Tornado can
run in the asyncio event loop and take advantage of the subgenerator
delegation syntax (yield from) to provide a high degree of concurrency
while keeping the simplicity of sequential code. It explains the
concept of coroutines, futures and ioloop, exposing Python 3 code for
sample web tasks. The talk completes with a basic demo of running this
code on Tornado, comparing its syntax and performance with popular
asynchronous frameworks from other languages."

At Blue Yonder, we've built a platform that can accept and process
bulk amounts of data for multiple business domains (e.g. handling
retail store location and sales data) using SQLAlchemy as a database
abstraction layer.

We wanted to use as much of SQLAlchemy as possible, but we quickly
found that the ORM (Object Relational Mapper) is not suitable for
handling large amounts of data at once. At the same time, we did not
want each team of developers working on individual business domains to
have to handcraft their own SQL statements. To solve this problem, we
built an application configuration that closely resembles an
SQLAlchemy model, but also contains application-specific logic
settings.

In this talk I will demonstrate:

 - an application architecture for multiple business domains

 - the structure of the domain configuration utilized in the
generation of the SQLAlchemy model, SQLAlchemy core statements, and
other application functionality

 - how the domain configuration is used throughout the application
(consuming and parsing incoming data, storing it in a database and

Ever feel like your open source project could be better tested? Lack
of tests holding you back from contributors but you don’t know where
to start? You’re not alone.

[“Adopt pytest month”][1] was held in April 2015. [Pytest][2] volunteers were paired with open source software projects, to find a path to better testing with pytest. Projects varied from  libraries/command line utilities, to a browser, to a complex Django app. In some cases converting existing tests was necessary, in others writing the first tests in existence for non-trivial amounts of code. Two projects were open sourced specifically to take part in “adopt pytest month”. What began as an experiment in increasing software audience proved to be an interesting exercise in strengthening community and most valuable of all, provided a newcomer’s perspective to veteran contributors.

This talk will discuss what worked well with “adopt pytest month”,
what didn’t, what we learned about pytest and what you could take away
for your open source project, be it an improved testing environment or
an improved contributor community. A basic knowledge of testing and
pytest will be useful.

Kotti is a high-level, Pythonic web application framework based on
Pyramid, SQLAlchemy and Bootstrap 3.  It includes an extensible
Content Management System called the Kotti CMS.  Kotti is particularly
well suited for building custom applications with object level
security.  It comes with complete user and group management and
supports the concepts of global and local roles providing management
views for each of those.

The talk will give an overview on Kotti, its philosophy, history and
future. Target audience are people who want to learn what it is and
can be used for.  Because Kotti is just a rather small layer on top of
its foundations, the talk might also give some interesting insights on
how to build a solid (web) framework that suits your personal
preferences.

How does a source file that you've installed or written become a
Python module
object, providing functions or classes for you to play with?

While the import mechanism is relatively well-documented in the
reference and dozens of PEPs, sometimes even Python veterans are
caught by surprise. And some details are little-known: did you know
you can import from zip archives? Write CPython modules in C, or even
a dialect of Lisp? Or import from URLs (which might not be a good
idea)?

This talk explains exactly what can happen when you use the import
statement – from the mundane machinery of searching PYTHONPATH through
subtle details of packages and import loops, to deep internals of
custom importers and C extension loading."

Locality sensitive hashing (LSH) is a technique for reducing complex

the original data is similar. Typically, they are used for speeding up
search and other similarity comparisons.

[EuroPython 2015]
[20 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]

Python is well established in software development departments of
research and industry, not least because of the proliferation of
libraries such as _SciPy_ and _Matplotlib_. However, when processing
large amounts of data, in particular in combination with GUI toolkits
(_Qt_) or three-dimensional visualizations (_OpenGL_), Python as an
interpretative programming language seems to be reaching its limits.
In particular, large amounts of data or the visualization of three-
dimensional scenes may overwhelm the system.

This presentation shows how visualization applications with special
performance requirements can be designed on the basis of _Matplotlib_
and _GR_, a high-performance visualization library for Linux, OS X and
Windows. The lecture focuses on the development of a new graphics
backend for _Matplotlib_ based on the _GR_ framework. By combining the
power of those libraries the responsiveness of animated visualization
applications and their resulting frame rates can be improved
significantly. This in turn allows the use of _Matplotlib_ in real-
time environments, for example in the area of signal processing.

Using concrete examples, the presentation will demonstrate the
benefits of the [GR framework][1] as a companion module for
_Matplotlib_, both in _Python_ and _Julia_. Based on selected
applications, the suitability of the _GR framework_ will be
highlighted especially in environments where time is critical. The
system’s performance capabilities will be illustrated using demanding
live applications. In addition, the special abilities of the _GR
framework_ are emphasized in terms of interoperability with graphical
user interfaces (_Qt/PySide_) and _OpenGL_, which opens up new
possibilities for existing _Matplotlib_ applications.

Perhaps there is no universal definition of high quality code, however
usually it's characterized as clear and readable, well-designed, well
tested and documented, easier to debug, maintain and extend, etc.

Python was designed to be a highly readable language that would make
it easier to develop high quality code. Nevertheless, programming

As an engineer working on any web stack, you may have heard about
Blocking and Non-Blocking IO. You may as well have used any framework
or library that supports Non-Blocking IO. After all, they are very
useful as you don't want to block execution of other tasks while one
task is waiting to complete a network call to another service (like
HTTP call to an API or may be a TCP call to your database). Non-
Blocking IO while doing tasks and not wait for IO. This also helps us
handle a lot many connections than we possibly could with Blocking IO.
Python supports Non-Blocking IO, but we always use some existing 3rd
party library that hides all the gory details and makes it all look
like black magic to the uninitiated. But there is nothing like black
magic.

This presentation will be an introductory talk focused at explaining
how Non-Blocking IO works, which is the basis of libraries like
Gevent, Tornado and Twisted. We will learn about how Non-Blocking IO
can be implemented using the most basic modules that form the base for
the above mentioned libraries. Hopefully after this talk, Non-Blocking
IO will not be an unsolved mystery for you anymore."

You will learn best practises and get a deeper understanding of what
tools and techniques can be used and how to deal with the most
challenging of web scraping projects!

We will cover crawling and extracting data at different scales - from
small websites to large focussed crawls. This will include an overview
of automated extraction techniques. We'll touch on common difficulties
like rendering pages in browsers, proxy management, and crawl

[EuroPython 2015]

[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]

The problem of introducing children to programming and computer science has
seen growing attention in the past few years. Initiatives like Raspberry
Pi, Code Club, code.org, (and many more) have been created to help solve
this problem. With the introduction of a national computing curriculum in
the UK, teachers have been searching for a text based programming language
to help teach computational thinking as a follow on from visual languages
like Scratch.

The educational community has been served well by Python, benefiting from
its straight-forward syntax, large selection of libraries, and supportive
community. Education-focused summits are now a major part of most major
Python Conferences. Assistance in terms of documentation and training is
invaluable, but perhaps there are technical means of improving the
experience of those using Python in education. Clearly the needs of
teachers and their students are different to those of the seasoned
programmer. Children are unlikely to come to their teachers with
frustrations about the Global Interpreter Lock! But issues such as
usability of IDEs or comprehensibility of error messages are of utmost
importance.

In this keynote, Carrie Anne will discuss existing barriers to Python
becoming the premier language of choice for teaching computer science, and
how learning Python could be helped immensely through tooling and further
support from the Python developer community."

[EuroPython 2015]
[24 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]

You've solved the issue of process-level reproducibility by packaging up
your apps and execution environments into a number of Docker containers.
But once you have a lot of containers running, you'll probably need to
coordinate them across a cluster of machines while keeping them healthy and
making sure they can find each other. Trying to do this imperatively can
quickly turn into an unmanageable mess! Wouldn't it be helpful if you could
declare to your cluster what you want it to do, and then have the cluster
assign the resources to get it done and to recover from failures and scale
on demand?

Kubernetes (http://kubernetes.io) is an open source, cross platform cluster
management and container orchestration platform that simplifies the complex
tasks of deploying and managing your applications in Docker containers. You
declare a desired state, and Kubernetes does all the work needed to create
and maintain it. In this talk, we’ll look at the basics of Kubernetes and
at how to map common applications to these concepts. This will include a
hands-on demonstration and visualization of the steps involved in getting
an application up and running on Kubernetes."

being able to focus on the goals at hand instead, using a single

why it is worthwhile doing, how it works, where we are and what still
needs to be done. I hope to convince you that this is an important
direction for web frameworks, and of how unique Reahl is. Developing
such an abstract framework is an ambitious goal. I'd like to convey
the message that what we have achieved so far, and the strategy
lessons learnt along the way demonstrate this goal to be realistic and

[Cython][1] is not only an excellent and widely used tool to speed up computational Python code, it's also a very comfortable way to talk to native code and libraries. The Cython compiler translates Python code to C or C++ code, and supports static type annotations to allow direct use of C/C++ data types and functions. The tight integration of all three languages makes it possible to freely mix Python features like generators and comprehensions with C/C++ features like native data types, pointer arithmetic or manually tuned memory management in the same code.

interactive code examples and presents recent enhancements in the
language that continue to make Cython the best choice for the

[EuroPython 2015]
[20 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]

Wrappers are an essential tool for interacting with web APIs. They
reduce the amount of work needed to make requests and sometimes, only
sometimes prevent the developer from dealing with extensive
documentations. It’s common to encounter libs that require not only
the study of their own documentation, but also the APIs one,
duplicating the needed work. This is caused because wrappers do not
follow a design pattern, each developer creates it’s own design,
coding style and use their preferred tools.

[Tapioca][1] is what can be called: ""a wrapper generator”. Creating API wrappers with Tapioca is extremely easy and fast. For example, it took 1 hour to write the full wrapper for the [Parse.com][2] REST API. But this is not the more important thing, Tapioca libs have a similar interface so once understood how they work, developers can work with any other without the need to learn a new interface.    

Tapioca is also thought to comply with REST features and takes HATEOAS
(Hypermedia as the engine of application state) seriously, so
“following” links and pagination are natively supported. Explorability
is also a key concept and developers are encouraged to play with
Tapioca packages and find their way through APIs before writing their
final code. Although there are some production ready [Tapioca
wrappers][3], it is a work in progress, there are still many features
to be explored.

One point usually underestimated or omitted when dealing with 
machine learning algorithms is how to write *good quality* code.
The obvious way to face this issue is to apply automated testing,
which aims at implementing (likely) less-buggy and higher quality
code.

However, testing machine learning code introduces additional concerns
that has to be considered. On the one hand, some constraints are
imposed by the domain, and the risks intrinsically related to machine
learning methods, such as handling unstable data, or avoid
under/overfitting. On the other hand,  testing scientific code
requires additional testing tools (e.g., `numpy.testing`),
specifically suited to handle numerical data.

In this talk, some of the most famous machine learning techniques will
be discudded and analysed from the `testing` point of view,
emphasizing that testing would also allow for a better understanding
of how the whole learning model works under the hood.

The talk is intended for an *intermediate* audience.
The content of the talk is intended to be mostly practical, and code
oriented. Thus a good proficiency with the Python language is **required**.

Traditional methods of coping with concurrent programming problems are
well-known and described in literature. Many programming languages,
including Python, contain in their standard libraries tools and
primitives such as semaphores and can spawn threads or subprocesses.

However, in the face of increasing interest in service oriented
architecture and building distributed systems, that span across many
independent server nodes, emerges a need to adapt traditional
solutions, so they can be applied in the new environment.

In this talk I will share my experiences gathered during building a
modern contact center - highly concurrent system, which requires
certain resources to be accessed exclusively by several self-contained
components."

[EuroPython 2015]
[20 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]

Abstract:

Using the automated documentation feature of Sphinx, you can make with
ease the extensive documentation of Python program.
You just write python function documents (docstrings), Sphinx
organizes them into the document, can be converted to a variety of
formats.
In this session, I'll explain a documentation procedure that uses with
sphinx autodoc and autosummary extensions.

Description:

Sphinx provides autodoc feature that generate document from docstring
in your python sources.
The docstring that contains description and example of the use of
function written near the program, makes doc easy to update.
In addition, the output of the Sphinx will make you understand what to
write in docstring. As a result, this will improve your motivation of
doc writing.

To use the autodoc, you must specify python modules to automodule
directive one by one. This is a tedious task, hoswever autosummary
extension automate this task.
In most cases, once developers have developed the API, you only need
to run the make html of Sphinx, you get a nicely formatted document.

Sphinx also has coverage and doctest extentions.
These support writing the documentation to work with autodoc.
This allow you to check the APIs that have not been documented or you
can verify each doctest part is correct or not.

If you use such autodoc-related extensions, you can create a Sphinx
API documentation in the following procedure.

1. make coverage; you can get the APIs that have not been documented.
2. Write docstrings that includes the doctest format how to use the API.
3. make doctest; you can verify each doctest part is correct or not.
4. make html; you can generate the HTML or your favorite format.

In this session, I'll explain a documentation procedure that uses with
sphinx autodoc, autosummary, coverage and doctest extensions.

gitfs is an open-source[1] filesystem which was designed to bring the
full powers of Git to everyone, no matter how little they know about
versioning. A user can mount any repository and all the his changes
will be automatically converted into commits. gitfs will also expose
the history of the branch you’re currently working on by simulating
snapshots of every commit.

gitfs is useful in places where you want to keep track of all your
files, but at the same time you don’t have the possibility of
organizing everything into commits yourself. A FUSE filesystem for git
repositories, with local cache.

In this talk we will take a look at some of the crucial aspects
involved in building a reliable FUSE filesystem, the steps that we
took in building gitfs, especially in handling the git objects (http
://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects), what testing
methods we have used for it and also we will share the most important
lessons learned while building it.

The prerequisites for this talk are:
A good understanding of how Git works
Basic understaning of Operating Systems concepts

Given the dynamic nature of Python, some bugs tend to creep in our
codebases. Innocents NameErrors or hard-to-find bugs with variables
used in a closure, but defined in a loop, they all stand no chance in
front of Pylint (http://pylint.org/).

In this talk, I'll present one of the oldest static analysis tools for
Python, with emphasis on what it can do to understand your Python
code.  Pylint is both a style checker, enforcing PEP 8 rules, as well
as a code checker in the vein of pyflakes and the likes, but its true
power isn't always obvious to the eye of beholder.  It can detect
simple bugs such as unused variables and imports, but it can also
detect more complicated cases such as invalid arguments passed to
functions, it understands the method resolution order of your classes
and what special methods aren't implemented correctly. Starting from
abstract syntax trees, we'll go through its inference engine and we'll
see how Pylint understands the logical flow of your program and what
sort of type hinting techniques are used to improve its inference,
including PEP 484 type hints. As a bonus, I'll show how it can be used
to help you port your long-forgotten library to Python 3, using its
new --py3k mode.

Take a big, non-multithreaded program, and run in on multiple cores!

PyPy, the Python implementation written in Python, experimentally
supports Software Transactional Memory (STM).  It runs without the
Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).

The strength of STM is not only to remove the GIL, but to also enable
a novel use of multithreading, inheritently safe, and more useful in
the general case than other approaches like OpenMP.  The main news
from last year's presentation is that there is now a way to get
reports about the ""STM conflicts"", which is essential to go past toy
examples.  With it, you can incrementally remove conflicts from large
code bases until you see a benefit from PyPy-STM.  The goal of the
talk is to give several concrete examples of doing that."

[Apache Spark][1] is a computational engine for large-scale data processing. It

is responsible for scheduling, distribution and monitoring applications which

consist of many computational task across many worker machines on a computing

cluster.

This Talk will give an overview of PySpark with a focus on Resilient

Distributed Datasets and the DataFrame API. While Spark Core itself is written

in Scala and runs on the JVM, PySpark exposes the Spark programming model to

Python. It defines an API for Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs). RDDs are a

distributed memory abstraction that lets programmers perform in-memory

computations on large clusters in a fault-tolerant manner. RDDs are immutable,

partitioned collections of objects. Transformations construct a new RDD from a

previous one. Actions compute a result based on an RDD. Multiple
computation steps

are expressed as directed acyclic graph (DAG). The DAG execution model is 

a generalization of the Hadoop MapReduce computation model.

The Spark DataFrame API was introduced in Spark 1.3. DataFrames envolve Spark's

RDD model and are inspired by Pandas and R data frames. The API provides

simplified operators for filtering, aggregating, and projecting over large

datasets. The DataFrame API supports diffferent data sources like JSON

datasources, Parquet files, Hive tables and JDBC database connections.

[EuroPython 2015]
[24 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]

RinohType is a document processor inspired by [LaTeX][1] and written
in Python. It renders [reStructuredText][2] and [Sphinx][3] documents
to PDF based on a document template and a style sheet. RinohType
already implements many of the features that make LaTeX so great. Not
stopping there, RinohType also tries to fix LaTeX's weaknesses; it
should not only be easy to use, but easy to _customize_ and _extend_
as well. To minimize frustration when things go wrong, care is taken
to provide descriptive warning and error messages. The powerful layout
engine makes it easy to define custom page layouts. And the CSS-
inspired stylesheets simplify the styling of document elements. At a
lower level, Python makes the writing of extensions much more
accessible when compared to TeX's rather arcane macro language.

In the talk, I would like to introduce RinohType to the Python
community. No special prerequisite knowledge is required. I will start
off by discussing my motivation for starting RinohType development,
its design goals and the currently available features. This will be
followed by an example of how you can use RinohType to render a
reStructuredText document to a neat PDF document, highlighting some of
the features along the way. Next, we'll explore some of RinohType's
internals such as the page layout engine and the style sheet system.
We will explore how these can be used in a Python application to
create a document from scratch.

A first RinohType release was recently created. While this preview
release is of alpha quality, it should be able to render most
reStructuredText documents. It also includes a preliminary Sphinx
builder. Please find more details in the package's description at

*(This talk is intended for intermediate-level participants who have a
basic understanding of the Python language and contains quotes from
Darth Vader that some attendees may find hilarious)*

Writing a Python script from scratch is fairly easy and you get on
with very little boilerplate code in general. However starting a new
Python project can be tiring if you decide to stick to best practices
and plan on submitting it to PyPI. It requires great diligence and
occasionally gets pretty cumbersome if you start new tools on a
regular basis.

You underestimate the power of a good template
----------------------------------------------

Why not just use a template for it? Cookiecutter is a CLI tool written
in pure Python that enables you to do so. Not only is it working for
Python code, but also markdown formats and even other programming
languages. We will talk about the ideas behind Cookiecutter and go
over how you can create your very own template, so you and others can
benefit from your experience.

I would like to briefly go into the technologies used and how you can
get involved in the Cookiecutter GitHub project. There are already
plenty of Cookiecutter templates, or Cookiecutters as we call them,
available online. Most of them target Python projects, but others can
be used to create C++, LaTeX or Javascript projects.

The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of
Cookiecutter.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------

I will show you how to use Cookiecutter and highlight some of the
amazing templates created by the community. More importantly we will
create a Cookiecutter template from scratch using the example of a
simple Kivy app and make use of advanced features such as post-gen
hooks, copy-without-render and templates in context values.

Finally I will recommend resources on how to follow up on this talk
and how to get in touch in case of any queries.

One of the problems programmers are most often faced with is the
parsing and validation of command-line arguments. If you're new to
Python or programming in general, you might start by parsing sys.argv.
Or perhaps you might've already come across standard library solutions
such as getopt, optparse or argparse in the official documentation.
While these modules are probably preferable to parsing sys.argv
yourself, you might wonder if there are more satisfactory solutions
outside of the standard library. Well, yes there are!

This talk will give you an overview of some popular alternatives to
the standard library solutions (e.g. click, docopt and cliff), explain
their basic concepts and differences and show how you can test your
CLIs."

A few months ago, Guido unfolded PEP 484, which was highlighted at
PyCon 2015 as a keynote presentation. This proposal would introduce
type hints for Python 3.5. While the debate is still roaring and
without taking a side, I believe that there is much to learn from
static type-checking systems.

The purpose of this talk is to introduce ways that could be used to
fully take over the amazing power that comes with static types, inside
a dynamic type language such as Python. The talk will go over what
exactly a static type system is, and what kind of problem it tries to
solve. We will also review Guido's proposal of type hinting, and what
it could mean to you. Finally, I will present a few libraries that are
available, such as Hypothesis  or various QuickCheck-inspired library
that tries to build more robust tests, how they achieve it and their
limitations. Throughout the talk, a lot of examples will used to fully
illustrate the ideas being explained.

At the end of this talk, you should have a better understanding of the
wonderful world of type systems, and what it really means to you. It
should help you decide wether using type hints will be helpful to you
and also if an external library trying to fuzz your tests has its
place inside your project"

[EuroPython 2015]

[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]

TDD is not about tests!
Well, actually, it’s not a about writing tests, or writing them before
the code. This talk will show you how to use tests to really drive
development by transforming business requirements into tests, and
allowing your code to come as their natural consequence.

Too often this key aspect is neglected and the result is that tests
and code are somehow “disconnected”. The code is not as short and
efficient as it could be, and the tests are not as effective.
Refactoring is not always easy, and over time all sorts of issues
start to come out of the surface.

However, we will show that when TDD is done properly, tests and code
merge beautifully into an organic whole that fulfills the business
requirements, and provides all sorts of advantages: your code is
minimal, easy to amend and extend, readable, clean. Your tests will be
effective, short and focused, and allow for light-hearted refactoring
and excellent coverage.

We will provide enough information and examples to spark the curiosity
of the novice, and satisfy the need of a deeper insight for the
intermediate, and help you immediately benefit from this
transformative technique that is still often underestimated and
misunderstood.

In this talk I will describe how to use Apache Spark (PySpark) with
some data from the World of Warcraft API from an iPython notebook.
Spark is interesting because it speeds up iterative processes on your
hadoop cluster as well as your local machine.

I will give basic benchmarks (comparing it to numpy/pandas/scikit),
explain the architecture/performance behind the technology and will
give a live demo on how I used Spark to analyse an interesting
dataset. I'll explain why you might want to use Spark and I'll also go
in and explain when you don't want to use it.

The dataset I will be using is a 22Gb json blob containing auction
house data from all world of warcraft servers over a period of time.
The goal of the analysis will be to determine when and if basic
economics still applies in a massively online game.

I will assume that the everyone knows what the ipython notebook is and
I will assume a basic knowledge of numpy/pandas but nothing fancy. The
dataset has been chosen such that people who are less interested in
Spark can still enjoy the analysis part of the talk. If you know very
little about data science but if you love video games then you should

[EuroPython 2015]
[22 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]

Software development is all about writing code that delivers
additional value to a customer. Following the agile and lean approach
this value created by code changes should be continuously delivered as
fast, as early and as often as possible without any compromise on the
quality.

Remarkably, there is a huge gap between the development of the
application code and the reliable and scalable operation of the
application. As an example, most of the tutorials about web
development with Flask or Django end by starting a local “dummy”
server, missing out all the steps needed for production ready
operation of the web service. Furthermore, as there is no “rocket
science” in-between, many proposals to bridge that gap from both
sides, operations and developers start with sentences like: “you just
have to...”, a clear indication that it will cause problems later on
and also a symptom of a cultural gap between developers and operations
staff.

In this talk I will go through the complete delivery pipeline from
application development to the industrial grade operation, clearly
biased towards the “DevOps” mindset. Instead of presenting a
sophisticated enterprise solution, I will outline the necessary
building blocks for continuous delivery and fill them up with simple
but working poor man's solutions, so that it is equally useful for
professional and non-professional developers and operations engineers.
After the talk you will know how to build such a continuous delivery
pipeline with open-source tools like “Ansible”, “Devpi” and “Jenkins”
and I will share some of my day-to-day experiences with automation in
general. Although many of the concepts are language agnostic I will
focus on the ins and outs in a python universe and outline the
pythonic way of “get this thing running”."

**Stop doing the same thing but expecting different results**

As developers we put considerable effort into optimisation. We are
always tinkering, trying to make things better, and striving to remove
antipatterns from our code and our development processes.

Yet for some reason we have not been as good at applying this spirit
of optimisation to the problem of increasing diversity, even though
most people these days agree that, like good tests, agile
methodologies, and virtual environments, diversity is a ""good thing"".

My position is that just as there is no single easy way to write good
code there is no single easy way to increasing diversity. There are,
however, several things that companies and organisations do which
actually work against diversity. This talk will explore these
antipatterns for diversity, including uncritical belief in
meritocracy, lack of understanding of the realities of
marginalisation, null processes, misunderstanding of ""culture fit"",
and an unwillingness to change, as well as some ways that teams,
companies, and organisations might work to combat them."

party library to be usable for common protocols. One year later,
asyncio has a strong community writing libraries on top of it.

The most advanced library is aiohttp which includes a complete HTTP
client but also a HTTP server. There are also libraries to access
asynchronously the file system, resolve names with DNS, have variables
local to tasks, read-write locks, etc. There are clients for AMQP,
Asterisk, ElasticSearch, IRC, XMPP (Jabber), etc. (and even an IRC
server!). There are asynchronous drivers for all common databases, and
even for some ORMs. As expected, there are tons of new web frameworks
based on asyncio. It's also possible to plug asyncio into Gtk, Qt,
gevent, eventlet, gunicorn, tornado, etc.

I will also discuss use cases of asyncio in production and benchmarks.
Spoiler: asyncio is not slow.

Have you ever worried that your tests aren't as good because they're
running against a fake or mock instead of the real thing?
Verified fakes solve this problem.
Verified fakes allow for simplified testing using fakes while still
providing the assurance that code tested using a fake implementation
will behave the same way when used with a real implementation.

The talk will begin with a case-study, demonstrating what it means to
write a ""verified fake"" implementation of a public API.
I will show how to write tests that verify a fake implementation of a
well defined API
and I will show how those same tests can be re-used to verify and test
real implementations of the same API.

The talk will end with a proposal that more libraries should include
verified fakes.
I will show, with real-world examples, how verified fakes can be used
by integrators
and discuss how they are superior to ad-hoc, unverified, mocking.

During the talk I will refer to various real world, Open Source
examples. Including:

* Flocker's Pluggable ""Block Device Backend"" [1]

  This API allows Flocker to manipulate file systems on OpenStack
Cinder Blocks and AWS EBS devices.
  It also makes it easy for third parties to implement their own
Flocker block device backends.

* Eliot's Memory Logger - and its use in testing and verifying logged messages.
* LibCloud's DummyNodeDriver - and its limitations.
* Boto - as an example of a library that could benefit from a
verified, introspectable fake.
* Docker-py - as an example of a library for which we have written a
verified fake.

There will be at least 5 minutes for discussion at the end of the talk.

[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]

Using an SQL database offers a bunch of advantages; first of all its
maturity and that it is understood by almost every software developer.
But it has at least one main disadvantage. As the data is structured,
if you want to modify the structure, for example on a long-running
project, you need a migration and therefore almost for sure, a
downtime.

When you have to make a migration, to modify the structure of data for
a small amount of records, it is so fast that it never gets
problematic. But if you think to modify the structure of tables
containing millions or billions of records, the time required to
simply apply the structural change is problematic.

Here are some changes we are working on at orderbird to go towards
zero downtime migrations using some of the latest improvements of

You need to download data from lots and lots of URLs stored in a text
file and then save them on your machine. Sure, you could write a loop
and get each URL in sequence, but imagine that there are so many URLs
that the sun may burn out before that loop is finished; or, you're
just too impatient.

For the sake of making this instructive, pretend you can only use one
box. So, what do you do? Here are some typical solutions: Use a single
process that creates lots of threads. Use many processes. Use a single
process and a library like asyncio, gevent or eventlet to yield
between coroutines when the OS blocks on IO.

The talk will walk through the mechanics of each approach, and then
show benchmarks of the three different approaches."

Traditional Python profiling tools have limitations.  Standard tools
like **cProfile** and most all third party tools (like **Python
Tools** plugin for Microsoft Visual Studio) suffer from common flaws.
First, the profiling overhead is high (up to 50%).  Second, the
information provided is “function-level” i.e. the  tool shows how much
time was spent within a function, but not actionable “line-level”
information to show which exact lines are _the bottleneck_ in a
function.  Adding “line-level” information to most tools causes the
application to run even slower. Third, some tools require modification
of the application source code to enable profiling thus disrupting
development.

This talk presents an experimental Python profiler.  It typically has
less than 15% overhead, shows line-level information and does not
require modification of application source code.  Experiments using it
resulted in performance gains of 2x and more.  Of course results vary
by application, but in a typical application there may be quick
optimizations easily identified by this type of profiler.

The talk will briefly describe the basics of what, why and how to
profile.  The profiler‘s use and results will be shown in the
presentation with examples based on real-life applications.  Previous
experience of working with profilers and trying to optimize an
application is a plus, but not required, to gain a better appreciation
of the work presented."

Python is a powerful language that provides many tools for creating
highly dynamic programs. It offers tools all across the complexity
spectrum that library authors can use to make their libraries seem
convenient to use for users.

While it's true that there are a wealth of techniques with huge
positive benefits, there are a number of common antipatterns which can
deceptively cause a net-loss in flexibility, readability, and
predictability for users.

We'll explore a few specific commonalities in this area of library and
object API design, and talk about the ramifications they have on each
of these programmer concerns."
HEOI8y0qHMk,Rob Collins - DumbDev -- eight rules for dumb development,PL8uoeex94UhGGUH0mFb-StlZ1WYGWiJfP,1016,6,5,0,00:37:11,2015-08-08 16:04:50,"Rob Collins - DumbDev -- eight rules for dumb development
[EuroPython 2015]
[24 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]

So often, we've been encouraged to be smart in our development. ""Work
smarter not harder!"" say the encouraging posters. But the desire to be
smart, and be seen to be smart, is hurting. The design suffers, the
code suffers, and it's hard to recruit developers smart enough to cope
with the problems caused.

In this talk, I'm proposing an alternative to being smart:
**_DumbDev_**. Let's use our brains for enjoyable, interesting things,
rather than wrestling with code written for smart developers.

**So what do I mean by _dumb_?**

Well, I don't mean 'ignorant'. A clever person can be ignorant of some
important information, and learn it. With ignorance, there is hope.
I'm also not talking about its opposite, 'stupidity'. This occurs when
someone is given the information or advice, and chooses to ignore it.
Dumb isn't stupid. Nor is it silent, as in someone who can't speak.

Instead, the picture I have is of one of the early computers: very
small RAM, disk space measured in KB, and a woefully inadequate CPU.
In other words, slow, with very little working memory and limited
persistent storage. Hey, this describes my brain -- and I realise
that's an asset! I will write better software if I take this into
account.

So, I'm a **_DumbDev_**, which means I can't hold in my mind the
infamous [Plone Site class hierarchy][1] (see [Michele Simionato's
article][2]). Rather than beat myself up about this, I can say, ""Hold
on, maybe deep inheritance is a bad idea..."" There is some debate
about the number of things we can think about simultaneously: it may
be 7, 9, 5, 4 or even only 3. We can learn some tricks to appear to
cope with more, but most of us can't easily do 38.

Here's the first **_DumbDev_** rule, putting a sensible limit on complexity:

&gt; **1. All diagrams must fit on a Noughts and Crosses (Tic-tac-toe) board**.

&gt; _One central class/concept and up to eight things linked. Larger
structures need to be subdivided._

There are seven further rules for me to explain in this talk. I will
demonstrate the benefits of the **_DumbDev_** approach, with good and
bad examples. At the end of the presentation, I hope you will realise
that you're a better developer than you thought at the start. The next
time it takes you two hours to debug a simple exception, you'll know
that it's not you. It's because the system wasn't written using
**_DumbDev_** rules.

Let's free our brains for more interesting things, like having ideas
and solving problems.

Let's do **_DumbDev_**.

The potential upside of microservices is significant and exciting. So
much so that Yelp's Transaction Platform committed from the start to
an architecture of small, cooperative microservices. This talk
explores the inevitable complications that arise for Python developers
in as the services grow larger and stretch both their own architecture
and the developers responsible for them. Come hear tales of terror
(tight coupling! low test coverage!), stories which will warm your
heart (agility! strong interfaces!), and everything in between as we
follow the adventures of our plucky team.

The talk will be focused on the functional, cultural, and reliability
challenges which occur as a microservices-based project evolves and
expands over time. Particular attention will be paid to where these
diverge from the utopian way microservices are often described, and to
the particular difficulties faced by Python developers trying to
implement such systems. My goal is to share with attendees some
mistakes we've made, some successful methods for growing gracefully,
and Python-specific tools/libraries which can help with these
problems.

To enjoy this talk, you should be aware of the basic vocabulary and
concepts of HTTP-based services. Any additional awareness of
distributed systems (and their failure modes) will be helpful."

[EuroPython 2015]
[23 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]

In static unit testing, the output of a function is compared to a
precomputed result. Even though such unit tests may apparently cover
all the code in a function, they might cover only a small subset of
behaviours of the function. This potentially allows bugs such as
heartbleed to stay undetected. Dynamic unit tests using fuzzing, which
allows you to specify a data generation template, can make your test
suite more robust.

In this talk, we demonstrate fuzzing using the hypothesis library.
Hypothesis is a Python library to automatically generate test data
based on a template.
Data is generated using a strategy. A strategy specifies how data is
generated, and how falsifying examples can be simplified. Hypothesis
provides strategies for Python's built-in data types, and is easily
customizable.Since test data is generated automatically, we can not
compare against pre-computed results. Instead, tests are usually done
on invariants of functions. We give an overview of such invariants.

Finally, we demonstrate how we use fuzzing to test machine learning
algorithms at Blue Yonder."

**[Full Video of Talk][0]**

Testing with purely random data on it's own doesn't get you very far. But
two approaches that have been around for a while have new libraries that
help you generate random input, that homes in on failing testcases.

First **[Hypothesis][1]**, a Python implementation and update of the
Haskell library
QuickCheck. Known as property based testing, you specify a property of your
code that must hold, and Hypothesis does its best to find a counterexample.
It then shrinks this to find the minimal input that contradicts your
property.

Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGim-BL_ebE#t=53m17s

Second, **[American fuzzy lop][2]** (AFL), is a young fuzzing library
that's already
achieved an impressive trophy case of bug discoveries. Using
instrumentation and genetic algorithms, it generates test input that
carefully searches out as many code paths as it can find, seeking greater
functional coverage and ultimately locating crashes and hangs that no other
method has found. I'll be showing how with **[Python-AFL][3]** we can apply this
tool to our Python code.

how to do just that.  Based on the source code of Dirigible, a short-
lived experiment in building a cloud-based Pythonic spreadsheet (now

We'll start from scratch, with a simple data representation for a two-
by-two grid, and then gradually build up the functionality of our
spreadsheet:
- Cell objects, and the formula/value distinction
- Evaluating cells, from simple arithmetic up to an Excel-like dialect
- Building up the dependency graph, and the ensuing fun times with
recursion (arg!)
- Integrating custom functions and user-defined code.

Showing and explaining code examples, and alternating with  live demos
(don't worry, I've done this before!)

And it's all in Python!  You'll be surprised at how easy it turns out
to be, when you go step-by-step, each building on the last... And I

scalable application:

 - **Automatic service registration and discovery** will allow your
application to grow itself automatically.

 -  **Health checking and service unregistration** will allow your
application to be fault tolerant, highly available and to shrink
itself automatically.

 - A **distributed Key/Value storage** will allow you to (re)configure
your distributed application nodes at once.

 - **Multi-Datacenter awareness** will allow your application to scale

While Python supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional
programming, its functional features are not fully developed. Mochi is
a Python-like functional language that compiles to Python 3 and PyPy 3
bytecode. It can use Python libraries and can be used from Python.

Mochi adds functional features such as tail recursion optimization, no
re-assignments in function definitions, persistent data structures,
pattern matching, algebraic data types, a pipeline operator, better
anonymous functions, Erlang-style actors, Lisp-style macros as well as
many useful builtin functions.

This talk presents what Mochi is, how it works, and what you can do
with it. Functional programming can help to solve certain kind of
problems elegantly. Done right, functional programs can be easily
tested and provide more confidence that you program is really doing
what you want. Mochi could be another tool in your toolbox. Functional
programming can expand your horizon and can be a lot of fun. Mochi
offers easy access to this new world because you can leverage your
existing Python knowledge and libraries whenever needed.

To accompany an upcoming O'Reilly book 'Data-visualisation with Python
and Javascript: crafting a dataviz toolchain for the web' (see
[here][1]) this talk aims to sketch out the toolchain by transforming
some dry Wikipedia data (Nobel prize-winners) into a far more engaging
and insightful web-visualisation. This transformative cycle uses
Python big-hitters such as Scrapy, Pandas and Flask, the latter
delivering data to Javascript's D3.

While Python is fast becoming the goto language for data-
processing/science, the visual fruits of that labour hit the wall of
the web, where there is only one first-class language, Javascript. To
develop a data-viz toolchain for the modern world, where web-
presentation is increasingly mandated, making Python and Javascript
play nicely is fundamental. This talk aims to show that the perceived
wall between the two languages is actually a thin, permeable membrane
and that, with a bare minimum of web-dev, one can get on with
programming seamlessly in both.

and querying becomes more difficult. Python already has excellent
tools for in-memory datasets, but we inevitably want to scale this
processing and take advantage of additional hardware. This is where
Blaze comes in handy by providing a uniform interface to a variety of

[EuroPython 2015]
[21 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]

Today, we almost exclusively think of code in software projects as a
collection of text files. The tools that we use (version control
systems, IDEs, code analyzers) also use text as the primary storage
format for code. In fact, the belief that ""code is text"" is so deeply
ingrained in our heads that we never question its validity or even
become aware of the fact that there are other ways to look at code.

In my talk I will explain why treating code as text is a very bad idea
which actively holds back our understanding and creates a range of
problems in large software projects. I will then show how we can
overcome (some of) these problems by treating and storing code as
data, and more specifically as a graph. I will show specific examples
of how we can use this approach to improve our understanding of large
code bases, increase code quality and automate certain aspects of
software development.

Finally, I will outline my personal vision of the future of
programming, which is a future where we no longer primarily interact
with code bases using simple text editors. I will also give some ideas
on how we might get to that future.

[EuroPython 2015]

The Python compiler Nuitka has evolved from an absurdly compatible
Python to C++ translator into a **statically optimizing Python
compiler**. The mere peephole optimization is now accompanied by full
function/module level optimization, with more to come, and only
increased compatibility.

Witness local and module **variable value propagation**, **function
in-lining** with suitable code, and graceful degradation with code
that uses the full Python power. (This is considered kind of the break
through for Nuitka, to be finished for EP.) No compromises need to be
made, full language support, all modules work, including extension
modules, e.g. PyQt  just works.

Also new is a plugin framework that allows the user to provide
workarounds for the standalone mode (create self contained
distributions), do his own type hinting to Nuitka based on e.g. coding
conventions, provide his own optimization based on specific knowledge.

Ultimately, Nuitka is intended to grow the Python base into fields,
where performance is an issue, it will need your help. Scientific
Python could largely benefit from future Nuitka. Join us now."

You've been making packages for a while now. Everything works almost
fine, however, lots of new features and tools have been developed
recently. Some are really obscure. And there's a chance they can save
you time and help you avoid _packaging-induced-pain_. I'm willing to
bet couple of beers you haven't seen these features and/or tools
before.

This talk is going to show you:

- Patterns and tricks you can use in your `setup.py`.
- Obscure pip/setuptools/virtualenv/python features you can use to
improve your packaging experience (be it as a user of packages or a
package author).
- Fledgeling alternative tools.

[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]

The talk is about the implementation of multibody simulation in the
scientific python world on the way to a stage usefull for engineering
and educational purposes.
Multibody simulation (MBS) requires two major steps: first the
formulation of the specific mechanical problem. Second step is the
integration of the resulting equations.
For the first step we use the package sympy which is on a very
advanced level to perform symbolic calculation and which supports
already Lagrange's and Kane's formalism. The extensions we made are
such that a complex mechanical setup can be formulated easily with
several lines of python code. The functionality is analogous to well
known MBS-tools, with that you can assemble bodies, joints, forces and
constraints. Also external forces even in a cosimulation model can be
added on top. The second step, the integration is done via ode-
integrators implemented in scipy.
Finally for visual validation the results are visualized with the
vpython package and for further analytics with matplotlib.

Conclusion: not only highly constrained pendulums with many rods and
springs but also driving simulation of passenger cars an be performed
with our new extension using python packages off the shelf."

[EuroPython 2015]
[24 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]

Python is an expressive general purpose programming language. Its
syntax provides many ways to represent structure and minimise code
repetition and boilerplate.

But Python not always expressible enough. Perhaps when you've built a
complicated enough system with hard-to-express inter-relationships,
the code required to construct or operate on it can become
complicated, repetitive and unreadable. Or perhaps you have users
unfamiliar with Python who need to understand or edit a system. In
cases like these, stepping beyond the syntax and semantics of basic
Python can be an advantage.

Daniel will describe various ways you can  implement your own Domain
Specific Languages, languages perhaps completely unlike Python that
can succinctly describe more complicated Python systems.

This talk will cover:

* What and why of DSLs
* Metaprogramming tricks
* Writing simple parsers
* The libraries PLY and PyParsing
* Building tooling around your new DSLs"

Knowing that your application is up and running is great. However in
order to make informed decisions about the future, you also need to
know in what state your application currently is and how its state is
developing over time.

This talk combines two topics that are usually discussed separately.
However I do believe that they have a lot of overlap and ultimately a
similar goal: giving you vital insights about your system in
production.

We'll have a look at their commonalities, differences, popular tools,
and how to apply everything in your own systems while avoiding some
common pitfalls.

Python may be the ideal language for teaching because of its
simplicity and readability, but actually getting a working and
consistent development environment installed on a diverse set of
student (or school) computers can be less than straightforward. And
then there's pip, numpy, scipy, windows vs unix command lines...

As a result, we've had lots of teachers coming to PythonAnywhere over
the years, to skip all these problems. We've recently started adding
some extra features to help teachers and students which we're keen to

The idea is that during this talk you bring your laptop with you, and make sure you have SQLAlchemy installed. At the beginning of the talk, we fire up our Python interpreter and start to explore the library in a structured way. In the next 25 minutes, we'll go hands on through the various parts of the SQLAlchemy. We try out the concepts of each part of the library and make sure the basics are well understood.

-----

In this talk will introduce the audience to SQLAlchemy in a well structured way, so that basic concepts are understood. This talk will be a combination of slides and interactive code editing in IPython. Both the working of SQLAlchemy as well as best practices in using SQLAlchemy will be demonstrated.

I will demonstrate the basic workings of:

* the SQL generation layer
* the DDL generation
* the ORM
* the session

[EuroPython 2014]
[22 July 2014]

This talk shows how to use Python's built in error handling mechanisms to keep the productive code clean, derive error messages helpful for the user directly from the code and release ressources properly.

-----

Traditionally error handling is regarded an annoyance by developers because it removes the focus from the already difficult enough productive parts of the code to parts that ideally will never be called. And even if, end users seem to be ignore the error messages and just click ""Ok"" or call the help desk.

Solution oriented error handling uses Python's existing try/catch/finally idiom, with statement, assert statement and exception hierarchy in a way that keeps the code clean and easy to maintain. It gives a clear distinction between errors that can be solved by the end user, the system administrator and the developer. Naming conventions and a simple set of coding guidelines ensure that helpful error messages can be easily derived from the code.

Most code examples work with Python 2.6+ and Python 3.x, on a few occasions minor differences are pointed out.

Topics covered are:

1. Introduction to error handling in Python
    - What are errors?
    - How to represent errors in Python
    - Detecting errors
    - Delegating errors to the caller
    - clean resource management
2. Principles of solution oriented error handling
    - responsibilities between user, admin and developer
    - when to use raise or assert
3. Error messages
    - What are ""good"" error messages
    - How to derive error messages from the source code
    - Adding context to the error
    - How to report errors to the user
4. Solution oriented usage of Python's exception hierarchy
    - admins fix `EnvironmentError`
    - users fix `DataError`
        - representing `DataError`
        - converting exceptions to `DataError`
    - developers fix everything else
    - special Python exceptions not representing errors
5. Template for a solution oriented command line application
6. Best practices for `raise` and `except`
    - When to use `raise`?
    - When to use `except`?

[EuroPython 2014]
[25 July 2014]

PyBuilder is a software build tool written in pure python which mainly targets 
pure python applications.
It provides glue between existing build frameworks, thus empowering you to focus on the big picture of the build process.
It will be shown through demonstrations and samples how a simple, 
human-readable and declarative configuration can lead to an astonishingly 
well-integrated build process which will make maintainers, developers and newcomers happy.

-----

# Why another build tool
Starting up a simple python project with best practices still takes a lot of boilerplate and glueing (e.G. chaining unit tests and integration tests in the build process, adding a linter, measuring coverage, ...).
It often results in extremely ugly homebrew scripts and edge-case solutions that are not reusable.
There are even programs out there (e.G. cookiecutter) that encourage boilerplate code generation!

# Build orchestration
PyBuilder borrows from the *maven* idea of phases (packaging, verifying, publishing, ...) to set up a fully declarative and automated build that can be run locally and remotely (build servers) in the very same way.
Rather than reinventing the wheel, it  provides glue between existing solutions (like unittest, coverage, flake8, ...) through a simple but powerful plugin mechanism.

# The talk
After a more theoretical talk with a colleague at PyConDE 2013, I want to show how it's actually like to work with *PyBuilder*.
This includes

 * starting up a project
 * running builds
 * using plugins
 * writing a plugin

The demo code will be made available on GitHub and I'll probably  have recordings prepped in case something goes wrong.

Reviewer FAQ
===============

### How does PyBuilder compare to other existing solutions like zc.buildout? 

As opposed to solutions like zc.buildout which focus on the *building* of complex projects (many parts, complex dependencies) PyBuilder emphasizes the full build process for very simple projects. Undoubtedly, buildout is more powerful for building in that regard and there is no reason to switch to PyBuilder.

However, for simple projects (a few packages, pure python) we believe that PyBuilder is better, especially if you're starting out with Python. The plugin architecture (as opposed to recipes) makes it easier to reason about what is going on. We are able to model dependencies between build phases  (like ""coverage"" needing ""unit tests"" and ""packaging"" needing ""integration tests"") where recipes are not. It also seems (after looking through the recipes available for buildout) that we have more focus on QA as part of the build process (lint code, differentiate between unit/integration tests, code analysis, ...). 

There is also a special focus on having the build descriptor written in Python (with fluent interfaces where possible) so that it is possible to understand what the configuration is by reading plain english, as opposed to zc.buildout (where the configuration is an ini file, or SCons which is very make-oriented).

In the end, a big difference between most build tools and PyBuilder is that PyBuilder is more about orchestration. We didn't reinvent packaging or linting,  we simply use what is already there (setuptools, flake8, pymetrics, ...). This allows users to use the tools they want without having to do the integration themselves, and still get a nice, unified build process out of it.

A simple example :

In buildout, code analysis can be done with 


```
[buildout]
parts += code-analysis

[code-analysis]
recipe = plone.recipe.codeanalysis
directory = ${buildout:directory}/src
```

This is not readable IMHO.
In PyBuilder it can look like this :

```
use_plugin('python.flake8')
project.set_property('flake8_include_test_sources', True)
project.set_property('flake8_ignore', 'E501')
project.set_property('flake8_break_build', True)
```


### ""It provides glue between existing build frameworks"" - which ones ? Could you name (some at least) ?

Currently there is only a plugin for building with distutils/setuptools. Should that change (e.G. new contender) it would be easy to switch using PyBuilder.

Examples where glue is needed : 

* Glue setuptools + unittest, so that no distribution can be shipped if tests fail
* Glue setuptools + coverage + unittest, so that no distribution can be shipped if the statement coverage is too low (configurable ofc)
* Glue setuptools + pip so that cloned projects can be built with their dependencies without needing to pip install manually"

-----

The talk will start from describing the setup we had for the last 7 years, i.e. Apache with mod_wsgi for Python projects and mod_php4/5 for PHP projects + nginx. I will explain why we used this setup for so long time, what problems we faced with this setup and what solutions we tried to solve them before switching to uWSGI.

Then I will tell about uWSGI, what it is, how it works and what features it has. I will show the comparison of configuration files, how simple it is to configure uWSGI compared to Apache.

Lastly I will explain how we managed to switch all our 800+ projects developed over the years in 2 different languages with 2 major versions changed (PHP4/5 and Python2/3), how this switch simplified our development and administration of this projects, the improvements we got in memory management and other areas.

Of course I will concentrate mainly on our Python projects because it is EuroPython after all and not EuroPHP ;-)"

Hosting this many sites reliably at a reasonable cost requires a well-designed infrastructure, but it uses the same standard components as many other Python-based websites.  We've built our stack on GNU/Linux, nginx, uWSGI, Redis, and Lua -- all managed with Python.  In this talk we'll give a high-level overview of how it all works, by tracing how a request goes from the browser to the Python application and its response goes back again.  As well as showing how a fairly large deployment works, we'll give tips on scaling and share a few insights that may help people running smaller sites discover how they can speed things up."

Adopting Python across a company brings extra agility and productivity not provided by traditional mainstream tools like Excel. This is the story of programmers teaching non-programmers, from different departments, to embrace Python in their daily work.

-----

By introducing ipython notebook, pandas and the other data analysis packages that make python even more accessible and attractive, we attempted to adapt python as a core technology across our whole company. We’ve challenged the dominant position of Microsoft Excel and similar tools, and dared to replace it by pandas-powered ipython notebooks.

During this transitional phase, we have been inspired and sometimes forced to develop multiple packages that extend pandas, numpy etc., in order to enable our colleagues, in other departments, to access all the data they need. Moreover, we are developing several high level functionalities for the notebook environment. 

The notebook environment is allowing us to be extremely responsive to the changes our users are asking for, since, for part of the work, we don’t have to go through the whole traditional development process.

The talk focuses on challenges and problems we’ve solved and managed in order to achieve our long term goal of creating highly agile, data-driven non-tech teams, free from the constraints imposed by mainstream technologies, and all of this thanks to python."

Ansible is a powerful DevOps swiss-army knife tool, very easy to configure and with many extensions built-in.
This talk will quickly introduce the basics of Ansible, then some real-life experience tips on how to use this tool, from setting up dev VMs to multi-server setups.

-----

Infrastructure/Scaling is a topic really close to me, I'd like to have the chance to talk about how we set this up in the company I work for. Our infrastructure is around 10-15 servers,  provisioned on different cloud providers, so a good size infrastructure.

Presentation is going to be divided in 3 parts, first part is going to be focused on comparing sysadmin and devops, then there will be an introduction to the basic concepts of Ansible. I want to spend most on the last part, which is going to give some tips based on our experience with it.

Many ideas will come from this presentation https://speakerdeck.com/fmarani/devops-with-ansible which i gave at DJUGL in London, with a longer session I will have more chances to delve into more detail, especially on how we use it, from vagrant boxes setup to AWS and DigitalOcean boxes, network configuration, software configurations, etc... 

I want to offer as many real-life tips as possible, without going too much offtopic as far as Ansible is concerned"

[EuroPython 2014]
[25 July 2014]

In this talk I will report on my efforts to update the DNS components of Twisted
and discuss some of the things I've learned along the way. I'll demonstrate the
EDNS0, DNSSEC and DANE client support which I have been working on and show how
these new Twisted Names components can be glued together to build novel DNS
servers and clients.
Twisted is an event-driven networking engine written in Python and
licensed under the open source MIT license.  It is a platform for
developing internet applications.

-----

# Description

My talk will consist of four main sections. Given the 30 minute time constraint,
I may shorten or drop the two introductory parts in favour of the narrative and
demonstration of interesting new APIs and code examples in the final two
parts. My experience of delivering a similar talk at PyconUK 2013 is that those
are the parts that will most interest the audience and prompt most audience
questions.

Here are my proposed sections with rough time allocations and descriptions:

## Introducing Twisted Names (0-5)

Twisted includes a comprehensive set of DNS components, collectively
known as Twisted Names.

-   &lt;https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedNames&gt;

I will begin the talk with a quick introduction to Twisted Names and its
capabilities, including one or two simple code examples.

## Introducing My Project (0-5)

With generous funding from The NLnet Foundation I am adding EDNS(0) and DNSSEC
client support in Twisted Names, including full DNSSEC verification and DANE
support.

In the talk I will quickly summarise the steps taken and lessons learned in
securing that funding, and hope to encourage the audience to seek funding to
support there own pet OSS projects.

## What's New in Twisted Names / Project Progress Report (10)

My project plan is divided into the following broad milestones.

1.  EDNS(0)

    1.  OPT record

    2.  Extended Message object with additional EDNS(0) items

    3.  EDNS Client

2.  RRSET handling

    1.  Canonical Form and Order of Resource Records

    2.  Receiving RRSETs

3.  DNSSEC

    1.  New DNSSEC Records and Lookup Methods

    2.  Security-aware Non-validating Client

    3.  Validating Client

4.  DANE

    1.  A twistd dns authoritative server capable of loading and serving TLSA
        records.

    2.  A Twisted web client Agent wrapper which performs TLSA lookup and
        verification of a server certificate.

    3.  A HostnameClientEndpoint which performs TLSA lookup and verification of a
        server certificate.

    4.  A command line tool for debugging TLSA records and for verifying a
        certificate file against a domain name.

    5.  A TLSA Record class for encoding and decoding TLSA bytes.

    6.  A TLSA lookup method which accepts port, protocol and hostname and constructs
        a suitable TLSA domain name.

In the talk I will quickly outline these goals, report on my progress so far,
and show running code examples to demonstrate the new APIs.

## Future Developments (5)

The aim of my project is to lay foundations that will eventually allow
end-to-end DNSSEC verification in all the core Twisted networking components,
including Twisted Conch (SSH), Mail (SMTP, POP3), Perspective Broker (RPC), Web
(HTTP, XML-RPC, SOAP), Words (XMPP, IRC).

Additionally I hope that this foundation work will encourage the development of
end-to-end DNSSEC verification in many of the Open Source and commercial
projects built on top of Twisted.

I will end the talk by outlining these exciting possibilities, and demonstrate
some code examples that illustrate these possibilities.

## Q & A (5-10)

I'm determined to leave at least five minutes at the end for audience
questions. At PyconUK 2013 I was frustrated because I ran out of time and ended
up answering questions outside the lecture theatre; questions which would have
been interesting to the whole audience."
3lhsA5ywh00,Daniel Pope - gevent: asynchronous I/O made easy,PL8uoeex94UhEomMao7wuOrOGuj3jxJYlz,312,0,1,0,00:44:01,2014-09-22 06:52:56,"Daniel Pope - gevent: asynchronous I/O made easy
[EuroPython 2014]
[23 July 2014]

gevent provides highly scalable asynchronous I/O without becoming a nest of callbacks, or even needing code changes.
Daniel will explain how to get started with gevent, discuss patterns for its use and describe the differences with Twisted, Tornado and Tulip/asyncio.

-----

It has been claimed ""Callbacks are the new GOTO"". Most asynchronous IO libraries use callbacks extensively.

gevent (http://www.gevent.org) uses coroutines to provide highly scalable asynchronous I/O with a synchronous programming model that doesn't need code changes and callbacks. By elegantly monkey patching the Python standard library, both your code and all pure Python libraries become asynchronous too, making a separate collection of protocol implementations (in the style of Twisted) unnecessary.

Code written like this is easier to understand, particularly for more junior developers. Crucially, IO errors can be raised at the right places.

I will be introducing gevent's programming model, why it's easier, walk through simple code samples, and discuss experiences and metaphors for programming with it."

How the Raspberry Pi Foundation are leading the way in the computing in schools revolution by providing affordable open and connectable hardware to people of all levels of experience.
Now we have an education team, we're pushing forward with creating resources and training teachers to help deliver modern computing education around the world.
All our learning resources are Creative Commons licensed and available on GitHub. We write materials that match the UK computing curriculum.

-----

I'm Ben, from Raspberry Pi. I do development and outreach for the Foundation and I work with the rest of the education team to help make learning through computer science, coding and hardware hacking more accessible to all.

In this talk I explain the Raspberry Pi story: its mission - the reason the Pi exists; what happened before release - getting the board in to production; what happened in the first two years - the community birth and growth; and what's coming next - education focus, new hardware and improved software.

Python is the main language used (and advocated by us) in education with Raspberry Pi.

We're creating learning resources to match up with the new UK computing curriculum, where we teach young people programming and computer science concepts with Python on Pi, and help teachers deliver quality material in the classroom to work towards the objectives the curriculum sets out to achieve.

With Raspberry Pi we open up possibilities for connecting to the real world in an accessible way using the powerful, high level and human read/write -able language of Python.

We work closely with the community: hobbyists organising Raspberry Jam events; educators teaching with Raspberry Pi; the software communities and their contributions - and we welcome any interested parties to get involved with helping us provide for the wider community."
NiSqG6s8skA,Petr Viktorin - The Magic of Attribute Access,PL8uoeex94UhEomMao7wuOrOGuj3jxJYlz,1757,23,0,0,00:26:47,2014-09-22 06:52:54,"Petr Viktorin - The Magic of Attribute Access
[EuroPython 2014]
[22 July 2014]

Have you ever wondered how the ""self"" argument appears when you call a method? Did you know there is a general mechanism behind it? Come learn all about attributes and descriptors.

-----

The first part of this talk will describe what exactly happens when you
read or write an attribute in Python.

While this behavior is, of course, explained in the Python docs,
more precisely in the [Data model][1] section and [related][2] [writeups][3],
the documentation gives one a ""bag of tools"" and leaves combining them
to the reader.

This talk, on the other hand, will present one chunk of functionality,
the attribute lookup, and show how its mechanisms and customization
options work together to provide the flexibility (and gotchas) Python provides.
The topics covered will be:

* method resolution order, with a nod to the C3 algorithm
* instance-, class-, and metaclass-level variables
* `__dict__` and `__slots__`
* data/non-data descriptors
* special methods (`__getattr__`, `__getattribute__`, `__setattr__`, `__dir__`)


In the second part of the talk, I will show how to use the customization
primitives explained before on several interesting and/or useful examples:

* A proxy object using `__getattr__`
* Generic desciptor - an ORM column sketch
* the rudimentary `@property`, method, `staticmethod` reimplemented in
  pure Python (explained [here][2] and elsewhere), which lead to
* SQLAlchemy's [`@hybrid_proprerty`][4]
* Pyramid's deceptively simple memoizing decorator, [`@reify`][5]
* An [""Unpacked"" tuple properties][6] example to drive home the idea that
  descriptors can do more than provide attribute access
  (and mention weak dicts as a way to non-intrusively store data on an object)


(These are subject to change as I compose the talk. Also some examples may
end up interleaved with the theory.)

Hopefully I'll have time to conclude with a remark about how Python manages to be
a ""simple language"" despite having these relatively complex mechanisms.

disruptive technologies is that even they can become disrupted when
something better comes along. What about Property-Based Testing?

[24 July 2014]

We present the Shogun Machine Learning Toolbox, a framework for Machine Learning, which is the art of finding structure in data, with applications in object recognition, brain-computer interfaces, robotics,  stock-prices prediction, etc. We give a gentle introduction to ML and Shogun's Python interface, focussing on intuition and visualisation.

-----

We present the Shogun Machine Learning Toolbox, a unified framework for Machine Learning  algorithms. Machine Learning (ML) is the art of finding structure in data in an automated way and has given rise to a wide range of applications such as recommendation systems, object recognition, brain-computer interfaces, robotics, predicting stock prices, etc.

Our toolbox offers extensive bindings with other software and computing languages, Python being the major target. The library was initiated in 1999 and remained under heavy development henceforth. In addition to its mature core-framework, Shogun offers state-of-the-art techniques based on latest ML research. This is partly made possible by the 21 Google Summer of Code projects (5+8+8 since 2011) that our students successfully completed. Shogun's codebase has &gt;20k commits made by &gt;100 contributors representing &gt;500k lines of code. While its core is written in C++, a unique of technique for generating interfaces allows usage from a wide range of target languages -- under the same syntax. This includes in particular Python, but also Matlab/Octave, Java, C#, R, ruby, and more. We believe that users should be able to choose their favourite language rather than us dictating this choice. The same applies for supported OS (Linux, Mac, Win). Shogun is part of Debian Linux.

Features of Shogun include most classical ML methods such as classification, regression, dimensionality reduction, clustering, etc, most of them in different flavours. All implemented algorithms in Shogun work on a modular data representation, which allows to easily switch between different sorts of objects as for example strings or matrices. Common ML-tasks and data IO can be carried under a unified interface. This is also true for the various external open-source libraries that are embedded within Shogun.

Code examples are provided for all implemented algorithms. The main and most complete set of examples is in the Python language. In addition, in order to push usage of Shogun in education at universities, we recently started adding more illustrative IPython notebooks. A growing list of statically rendered versions are readily available from our [website](http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/page/documentation/notebook) and implement a cross-over of tutorial-style explanations, code, and visualization examples. We even took this up a notch and started building our own IPython-notebook server with Shogun installed in the cloud at (try cloud button in notebook view) . This allows users to try Shogun without installation via the IPython notebook web interface. All example notebooks can be loaded, interactively modified, and executed. In addition, using the Python Django framework, we built a collection of interactive web-demos where users can play around with basic ML algorithms, [demos](http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/page/documentation/demo)

In the proposed talk, we will give a gentle and general introduction to ML and the core functionality of Shogun, with a focus on its Python interface. This includes solving basic ML tasks such as classification and regression and some of the more recent features, such as last year's GSoC projects and their IPython notebook writeups. ML material will be presented with a focus on intuition and visualisation and no previous familiarity with ML methods is required.

## Key points in the talk

 * What are the goals in ML?
 * Example problems in ML (classification, regression, clustering)
 * Some basic algorithm ideas
 * Focus on Visualisation, not Maths

## Intended Audience

* All people dealing with data (data scientists, big-data hackers) who are looking for tools to deal with it
 * People with a general interest but no education in Machine Learning

[EuroPython 2014]
[22 July 2014]

When a mobile game development company decides to switch to a more cloud based development it is faced with obstacles different from those it’s used to on mobile devices. This talk explains how Python provided us with most of the infrastructure for this task and how a Python game backend was built as a result.

-----

#### The Talk

This talk has two goals. Showing the audience the lessons we learned during a project which moved a simple mobile game to a server backend is our first intention. In addition to that we want to describe how such a system works in a real life example, to show which problems and which requirements arise in its creation. When the audience leaves the talk they will know how a real-life mobile game uses Python for powering the backend servers.

 
#### The Problem

Most of the game development for mobile devices is focused on running the game on the device. The game designers and game developers play a primary role in creating the product. The server backend plays a supporting role providing a multiplayer or social experience to the users. Indeed, at Nanobit Ltd., things were also done that way. We had a small Python infrastructure built around Django which provided a small portion of multiplayer experience for the players. The majority of development was still focused on playing the game on the device. That way of thinking was put to test when we decided to center our future games around the multiplayer experience. Due to the fact that our infrastructure at the time was not enough for what we had in mind, we had to start from scratch. The decision was made to use Python as the center of our new infrastructure.

In order to achieve it, a server backend was needed that would allow the game to be played “in the cloud” with the device only being a terminal to the player. Most of the game logic would have to be processed in the cloud which meant that each player required a constant connection to the backend and with over 100.000 players in our previous games that presented a challenge. How to build an infrastructure which can support that? Since every user action had to be sent to the backend how to process thousands of them quick enough? Those problems were big and were just the start.


#### The Solution

The design of the backend lasted for a couple of months and produced a scalable infrastructure based on “workers” developed in Python, “web servers” that use Tornado and a custom message queue which connected the two. The storage part is a combination of Riak and Redis. Since the backend is scalable new workers and new web servers had to be deployed easily so an orchestration module was build using Fabric. The scalability and launching of new workers and web servers was achieved using Docker for creation and deployment of containers. Each container presents one module of the system (worker, web server, queue). The end result can now support all of our future games and only requires the game logic of each game to be added to the workers.


#### The Technologies

* Python for coding the game logic, web servers. More than 90% of the system was written in Python.
* Fabric
* SQLAlchemy
* Riak
* Redis
* ZeroMQ
* nginx
* Docker
* Websockets
* AWS


#### The Lessons Learned

* How to tune the backend to handle the increasing number of active players.
* How to tackle the problem of frequent connection dropping and reachability issues of poor mobile device Internet connection in Tornado with a little help of Redis.
* How to prevent users from trying to outsmart the system by denying illegal moves.
* How to enable game profile syncing and live updating.
* Improving the performance of workers by prioritizing data being stored to databases (Riak, SQL).
* New issues and lessons show up all the time so there will definitely be more of them by the time of the conference.

[25 July 2014]

Python developers often get frustrated when managing visualization packages that cover the specific needs in scientific or engineering environments. The GR framework could help. GR is a library for visualization applications ranging from publication-quality 2D graphs to the creation of complex 3D scenes and can easily be integrated into existing Python environments or distributions like Anaconda.

-----

Python has long been established in software development departments of research and industry, not least because of the proliferation of libraries such as *SciPy* and *Matplotlib*. However, when processing large amounts of data, in particular in combination with GUI toolkits (*Qt*) or three-dimensional visualizations (*OpenGL*), it seems that Python as an interpretative programming language may be reaching its limits.

[EuroPython 2014]
[23 July 2014]

Finding bugs before runtime has been an incredibly tedious task in Python. Jedi is an autocompletion library with interesting capabilities: It understands a lot of the dynamic features of Python. I will show you how we can use the force of (the) Jedi to identify bugs in your Python code. It's not just another pylint. It's way better.

-----

Jedi is an autocompletion library for Python that has gained quite a following over the last year. There are a couple of plugins for the most popular editors (VIM, Sublime, Emacs, etc.) and mainstream IDEs like Spyder are switching to Jedi.

Jedi basically tries to redefine the boundaries of autocompletion in dynamic languages. Most people still think that there's no hope for decent autocompletion in Python. This talk will try to argue the opposite, that decent autocompletion is very close.

While the first part will be about Jedi, the second part of this talk will discuss the future of dynamic analysis. Dynamic Analysis is what I call the parts that static analysis doesn't cover. The hope is to generate a kind of ""compiler"" that doesn't execute code but reports additional bugs in your code (AttributeErrors and the like). 

I still have to work out the details of the presentation. I also have to add that Jedi I'm currently working full-time on Jedi and that there's going to be some major improvements until the conference. Autocompletion and static/dynamic analysis as well as refactoring are hugely important tools for a dynamic language IMHO, because they can improve the only big disadvantage compared to static languages: Finding bugs before running your tool."

[EuroPython 2014]
[24 July 2014]

Scikit-learn is a powerful library, providing implementations for 
many of the most popular machine learning algorithms. 
This talk will provide an overview of the ""batteries"" included in 
Scikit-learn, along with working code examples and internal insights, in order to 
get the best for our machine learning code.

-----

**Machine Learning** is about *using the right features, to build the right 
models, to achieve the right tasks* [[Flach, 2012]][0]
However, to come up with a definition of what actually means **right** for 
the problem at the hand, it is required to analyse 
huge amounts of data, and to evaluate the performance of different algorithms 
on these data.

However, deriving a working machine learning solution for a given problem 
is far from being a *waterfall* process. 
It is an iterative process where continuous refinements are required for the 
data to be used (i.e., the *right features*), and the algorithms to apply 
(i.e., the *right models*).

In this scenario, Python has been found very useful for practitioners and 
researchers: its high-level nature, in combination with available tools and 
libraries, allows to rapidly implement working machine learning code 
without *reinventing the wheel*.

[**Scikit-learn**](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is an actively 
developing Python library, built on top of the solid `numpy` and `scipy` 
packages.

Scikit-learn (`sklearn`) is an *all-in-one* software solution, providing 
implementations for several machine learning methods, along with datasets and 
(performance) evaluation algorithms.

These ""batteries"" included in the library, in combination with a nice and intuitive
software API, have made scikit-learn to become one of the most popular Python 
package to write machine learning code.

In this talk, a general overview of scikit-learn will be presented, along with 
brief explanations of the techniques provided out-of-the-box by the library.

These explanations will be supported by working code examples, and insights on 
algorithms' implementations aimed at providing hints on 
how to extend the library code.

Moreover, advantages and limitations of the `sklearn` package will be discussed 
according to other existing machine learning Python libraries
(e.g., [`shogun`](http://shogun-toolbox.org ""Shogun Toolbox""), 
[`pyML`](http://pyml.sourceforge.net ""PyML""), 
[`mlpy`](http://mlpy.sourceforge.net ""MLPy"")).

In conclusion, (examples of) applications of scikit-learn to big data and 
computational intensive tasks will be also presented.

The general outline of the talk is reported as follows (the order of the topics may vary):

*   Intro to Machine Learning
    *   Machine Learning in Python
    *   Intro to Scikit-Learn
*   Overview of Scikit-Learn
    *   Comparison with other existing ML Python libraries
*   Supervised Learning with `sklearn`
    *   Text Classification with SVM and Kernel Methods
*   Unsupervised Learning with `sklearn`
    *   Partitional and Model-based Clustering (i.e., k-means and Mixture Models)
*   Scaling up Machine Learning
    *   Parallel and Large Scale ML with `sklearn`

The talk is intended for an intermediate level audience (i.e., Advanced).
It requires basic math skills and a good knowledge of the Python language.

Good knowledge of the `numpy` and `scipy` packages is also a plus.

Vumi is a text messaging system designed to reach out to those in
poverty on a massive scale via their mobile phones. It's written in
Python using Twisted. This talk is about how and why we built it and
how you can join us in making the world a better place.

-----

43% of the world's population live on less than €1.5 per day.

The United Nations defines poverty as a ""lack of basic capacity to
participate effectively in society"".  While we often think of the poor
as lacking primarily food and shelter, the UN definition highlights
their isolation. They have the least access to society's knowledge and
services and the most difficulty making themselves and their needs
heard in our democracies.

While smart phones and an exploding ability to collect and process
information are transforming our access to knowledge and the way we
organize and participate in our societies, those living in poverty
have largely been left out. This has to change.

Basic mobile phones present an opportunity to effect this change
[3]. Only three countries in the world have fewer than 65 mobile
phones per 100 people [4]. The majority of these phones are not
Android or iPhones, but they do nevertheless provide a means of
communication -- via voice calls, SMSes [6], USSD [7] and instant
messaging.

By comparison, 25 countries have less than 5% internet penetration
[5].

Vumi [1] is an open source text messaging system designed to reach out
to those in poverty on a massive scale via their mobile phones. It's
written in Python using Twisted.

Vumi is already used to:

* provide Wikipedia access over USSD and SMS in Kenya [8].
* register a million voters in Libya [10].
* deliver health information to mothers in South Africa [9].
* prevent election violence in Kenya [11].

This talk will cover:

* a brief overview of mobile networking and cellphone use in Africa
* why we built Vumi
* the challenges of operating in unreliable environments
* an overview of Vumi's features and architecture
* how you can help!

Vumi features some cutting edge design choices:

* horizontally scalable Twisted processes communicating using RabbitMQ.
* declarative data models backed by Riak.
* sharing common data models between Django and Twisted.
* sandboxing hosted Javascript code from Python.

Overview of challenges Vumi addresses:

*Scalability*: Vumi needs to support both small scale applications (demos, pilot projects, applications tailored for a particular community) and large ones (things that everyone within a country might use). We address this using Twisted workers that exchange messages via RabbitMQ and store data in Riak. Having projects share RabbitMQ and Riak instances significantly reduces the overhead for small projects (e.g. its not cost effective to launch the recommended minimum of 5 Riak servers for a small project).

*Barriers to entry*: Often the people with good ideas don't have access to one of many things needed to run a production system themselves, e.g. capital, time, stable infrastructure. We address this by providing a hosted Vumi instance that runs sandboxed Javascript applications. All the application author needs is their idea, the ability to write Javascript and upload it to our servers. The target audience here is African entrepreneurs at incubator spaces like iHub (Nairobi), kLab (Kigali), BongoHive (Lusaka) and JoziHub (Johannesburg).

*Unreliable third-party systems*: It's one thing for parts of ones own system to go down, it's another for crucial third-party systems to go down. Vumi takes an SMTP-like approach to solving this and uses persistent queues so that messages can back up in the queue while third-party systems are down and be processed when they become available again. We also feedback information on whether third-party messaging systems have accepted or reject messages to the application that initiated them.

Vumi is developed by the Praekelt Foundation [2] (and individual contributors!).

[EuroPython 2014]
[24 July 2014]

My path from 'Hello world' to software development was long and hard. The approach I learned during my research may help you to create high quality software and improve as a developer. The talk covers how you can benefit from your non-IT knowledge, atomize your project and how collaboration accelerates your learning.

-----

**Goal**: give practical tools for improving skills and software quality to people with a background other than IT.

Eight years ago, as a plant biologist, I knew almost nothing about programming. When I took a course in python programming, I found myself so fascinated that it altered my entire career. I became a scientific software developer. It was long and hard work to get from the level of 'Hello world' to the world of software development. The talk will cover how to embrace a non-IT education as a strength, how and why to atomize programming tasks and the importance of doing side projects.

### 1. Embrace your background
Having domain specific knowledge from a field other than IT helps you to communicate with the team, the users and the group leader. It prevents misunderstandings and helps to define features better. A key step you can take is systematically apply the precise domain specific language to the code e.g when naming objects, methods or functions. Another is to describe the underlying scientific process step by step as a Use Case and write it down in pseudocode.

### 2. Atomisation
Having a set of building block in your software helps to define responsibilities clearly. Smaller parts are easier to test, release and change. Modular design makes the software more flexible and avoids the Blob and Lava Flow Anti-Patterns. When using object oriented programming a rule of thumb is that an object (in Python also a method) does only one thing. You can express this Single Responsibility Principle as a short sentence for each module. Another practical action is to introduce Design Patterns that help to decouple data and its internal representation. As a result, your software becomes more flexible.
 
### 3. Participating in side projects
Learning from others is a great opportunity to grow. Through side projects you gain a fresh perspective and learn about best practices in project management. You gain new ideas for improvement and become aware of difficulties in your own project. You can easily participate in a scientific project by adding a small feature, writing a test suite or provide a code review on a part of a program.

Summarizing, in scientific software development using domain-specific knowledge, atomisation of software, and participation in side projects are three things that help to create high quality software and to continuously improve as a developer.

The talk will address challenges in areas where science differs from the business world. It will present general solution one might use for software developed in a scientific environment for research projects rather then discussing particular scientific packages. 

### Qualifications
During my PhD I developed a software on 3D RNA modeling (www.genesilico.pl/moderna/) that resulted in 7 published articles. I am coauthor on a paper on bioinformatic software development. Currently I am actively developing a system biology software in Python at the Humboldt University Berlin (www.rxncon.org)."

[25 July 2014]

Although maybe not very well known in the Python community there exists a powerful statistical open-source ecosystem called R. Mostly used in scientific contexts it provides lots of functionality for doing statistical analysis, generation of various kinds of plots and graphs, and much, much more.
The triplet R, Rserve, and pyRserve allows the building up of a network bridge from Python to R: Now R-functions can be called from Python as if they were implemented in Python, and even complete R scripts can be executed through this connection.

-----

pyRserve is a small open source project originally developed to fulfill the needs of a German biotech company to do statistical analysis in a large Python-based Lab Information Management System (LIMS). In contrast to other R-related libraries like RPy where Python and R run on the same host, pyRserve allows the distribution of complex operations and calculations over multiple R servers across the network. 

The aim of this talk is to show how easily Python can be connected to R, and to present a number of selected (simple) code examples which demonstrate the power of this setup."

A lot of great Python tools exist to analyse and report on your codebase, but they can require a lot of  initial set up to be useful. Done right, they can be like an automatic code review. This talk will explain how to set up and get the best out of these tools, especially for an existing, mature codebase.

-----

Static analysis tools are a great idea in theory, but are not often really used in practice. These tools usually require quite a lot of initial effort to get set up in a way which produces meaningful output for you or your organisation's particular coding style and values. As a result, it's common to see initial enthusiasm replaced by ignoring the tools.

Such tools can be incredibly beneficial however, and even go so far as to provide an automatic code review, and this talk will explain what kind of benefits you can get from the tools, as well as explain what you can and cannot expect. 

This talk is aimed at experienced developers who are interested in improving their coding practices but who have either never tried static analysis tools, or who have not seen the upsides. It will hopefully also be useful to people who do use the tools, perhaps introducing them to new tools or concepts they were not aware of yet."

Your library supports only Python 2, - but your users keep nagging you about Python 3 support?

As Python 3 gets adopted more and more, users ask for Python 3 support in existing libraries for Python 2. This talk mentions some approaches for giving users a Python 3 version, but will quickly focus on using the very same code for a Python 2 and a Python 3 version.

This is much easier if you require Python 2.6 and up, and yet a bit easier if you require Python 3.3 as the minimum Python 3 version.

The talk discusses main problems when supporting Python 3 (some are easily solved):

* `print` is a function.

* More Python APIs return iterators that used to return lists.

* There's now a clear distinction between bytes and unicode (text) strings.

* Files are opened as text by default, requiring an encoding to apply on reading and writing.


The talk also explains some best practices:

* Start with a good automatic test coverage.

* Deal with many automatic conversions with a one-time 2to3 run.

* Think about how your library should handle bytes and unicode strings. (Rule of thumb: Decode bytes as early as possible; encode unicode text as late as possible.)

* Should you break compatibility with your existing Python 2 API? (Yes, if there's no other way to design a sane API for Python 2 and 3. If you do it, raise the first part of the version number.)

* Try to keep code that's different for Python 2 and 3 minimal. Put code that needs to be different for Python 2 and 3 into a `compat` module. Or use third-party libraries like `six` or `future`.


Finally, the talk will mention some helpful resources on the web."

[24 July 2014]

Deploying your software can become a tricky task, regardless of the
language. In the spirit of the Python conferences, every conference
needs at least one packaging talk.
This talk is about dh-virtualenv. It's a Python packaging tool aimed
for Debian-based systems and for deployment flows that already take
advantage of Debian packaging with Python virtualenvs

-----

[Dh-virtualenv][1] is an open source tool developed at Spotify. We use it
to ease deploying our Python software to production. We built dh-virtualenv as a tool that fits our existing continuous integration flow with a dedicated sbuild server.
As we were already packaging software in Debian packages, the
aim of dh-virtualenv was to make transition to virtualenv based installations as smooth as possible.

This talk covers how you can use dh-virtualenv to help you deploy your
software to production, where you are already running a Debian-based system, such as Ubuntu, and what are the advantages and disadvantages of the approach over other existing and
popular techniques. We will discuss the deploying as a problem in
general, look into building a dh-vritualenv-backed package, and in the
end, look into how dh-virtualenv was actually made.

Goal is that after this presentation you know how to make your Debian/Ubuntu deployments easier!

[dh-virtualenv][1] if fully open sourced, production tested software,
licensed under GPLv2+ and available in Debian testing and unstable.

More information of it is also available in our [blogpost][2].

[EuroPython 2014]
[25 July 2014]

WebRTC makes building peer to peer real time web applications easier. First, we'll discuss in short what WebRTC is, how it works. Then we will explore ways to build the signalling system of a WebRTC app using Python.

-----

Introduction
===========
This talk will first introduce the audience to WebRTC and then discuss about how to implement the server side logic of a WebRTC app using Python. 

WebRTC is a free, open project that enables web browsers with plugin-less Real-Time Communications (RTC) capabilities via simple JavaScript APIs. What makes WebRTC special is that the data travels from one client to another without going through the server. 

The main functions of WebRTC can be broadly categorized into three types. 

- Access and acquire video and audio streams
- Establish a connection between peers and stream audio/video.
- Communicate arbitrary data.

WebRTC uses three different JavaScript APIs to perform these three functions. These APIs are:

- MediaStream (aka getUserMedia)
- RTCPeerConnection
- RTCDataChannel

MediaStream API performs the task of accessing the webcam and/or microphone of the device and acquire the video and/or audio stream from them. RTCPeerConnection API establishes connection between peers and streams audio and video data. This API also does all the encoding and decoding of audio/video data. The third API, RTCDataChannel helps to communicate arbitrary data from one client to the other.

There will be short demos to demonstrate the functionalities of these APIs.

Signaling and Session Control
========================

WebRTC uses RTCPeerConnection to communicate streaming data between browsers, but some sort of mechanism is needed to coordinate this communication and to send control messages. This process is known as signaling.

Signaling is used to exchange three types of information.

- Session control messages: to initialize or close communication and report errors.
- Network configuration: to the outside world, what's my computer's IP address and port?
- Media capabilities: what codecs and resolutions can be handled by my browser and the browser it wants to communicate with?

This can be implemented using any appropriate two way communication channel.

Implementing signaling in Python
==========================

Next, we will have a look at how to implement this signaling mechanism in Python. ( Demonstration with annotated code and live application.)

### Google AppEngine and the Channel API ###
Google AppEngine has a channel API which offers persistent connections between your application and Google servers, allowing your application to send messages to JavaScript clients in real time without the use of polling. We'll use this Channel API to build the signaling system of our WebRTC app on top of webapp2 and flask framework. 

### Flask and gevent ###
We'll implement the same signaling system again, this time on top of Flask using gevent for the persistent connection between the browser and our application.

[EuroPython 2014]
[25 July 2014]

This talk will focus on you can readily implement highly scalable and fault tolerant realtime architectures, such as dashboards, using Python and tools like Storm, Kafka, and ZooKeeper. We will focus on two related aspects: composing reliable systems using at-least-once and idempotence semantics and how to partition for locality.

-----

Increasingly we are interested in implementing highly scalable and
fault tolerant realtime architectures such as the following:

* Realtime aggregation. This is the realtime analogue of working with
  batched map-reduce in systems like Hadoop.

* Realtime dashboards. Continuously updated views on all your
  customers, systems, and the like, without breaking a sweat.

* Realtime decision making. Given a set of input streams, policy on
  what you like to do, and models learned by machine learning, optimize a
  business process. One example includes autoscaling a set of servers.

(We use realtime in the soft sense: systems that are continuously
computing on input streams of data and make a best effort to keep up;
it certainly does not imply hard realtime systems that strictly
bound their computation times.)

Obvious tooling for such implementations include Storm (for event
processing), Kafka (for queueing), and ZooKeeper (for tracking and
configuration). Such components, written respectively in Clojure
(Storm), Scala (Kafka), and Java (ZooKeeper), provide the desired
scalability and reliability. But what may not be so obvious at first
glance is that we can work with other languages, including Python, for
the application level of such architectures. (If so inclined, you can
also try reimplementing such components in Python, but why not use
something that's been proven to be robust?)

In fact Python is likely a better language for the app level, given
that it is concise, high level, dynamically typed, and has great
libraries. Not to mention fun to write code in! This is especially
true when we consider the types of tasks we need to write: they are
very much like the data transformations and analyses we would have
written of say a standard Unix pipeline. And no one is going to argue
that writing such a filter in say Java is fun, concise, or even
considerably faster in running time.

So let's look at how you might solve such larger problems. Given that
it was straightforward to solve a small problem, we might approach as
follows. Simply divide up larger problems in small one. For example,
perhaps work with one customer at a time. And if failure is an ever
present reality, then simply ensure your code retries, just like you
might have re-run your pipeline against some input files.

Unfortunately both require distributed coordination at scale. And
distributed coordination is challenging, especially for real systems,
that will break at scale. Just putting a box in your architecture
labeled **""ZooKeeper""** doesn't magically solve things, even if
ZooKeeper can be a very helpful part of an actual solution.

Enter the Storm framework. While Storm certainly doesn't solve all
problems in this space, it can support many different types of
realtime architectures and works well with Python. In particular,
Storm solves two key problems for you.

**Partitioning**. Storm lets you partition streams, so you can break
down the size of your problem. But if the a node running your code
fails, Storm will restart it. Storm also ensures such topology
invariants as the number of nodes (spouts and bolts in Storm's lingo)
that are running, making it very easy to recover from such failures.

This is where the cleverness really begins. What can you do if you can
ensure that **all the data** you need for a given continuously updated
computation - what is the state of this customer's account?  - can be
put in **exactly one place**, then flow the supporting data through it
over time? We will look at how you can readily use such locality in
your own Python code.

**Retries**. Storm tracks success and failure of events being
processed efficiently through a batching scheme and other
cleverness. Your code can then choose to retry as necessary. Although
Storm also supports exactly-once event processing semantics, we will
focus on the simpler model of at-least-once semantics. This means your
code must tolerate retry, or in a word, is idempotent. But this is
straightforward. We have often written code like the following:

    seen = set()
    for record in stream:
        k = uniquifier(record)
        if k not in seen:
           seen.add(k)
           process(record)

Except of course that any such real usage has to ensure it doesn't
attempt to store all observations (first, download the Internet! ;),
but removes them by implementing some sort of window or uses data
structures like HyperLogLog, as we will discuss."

After half a lifetime ""undercover as a man"" I transitioned from male to female while staying involved in the Python community. This talk discusses that transition and explores how I found life in Python as a woman different from my former life as a man and the lessons about diversity I have learned.

This talk will include a brief discussion of what being transgender means, my experiences as I came to terms with it, and the losses and gains transition entailed. Early on I made the decision to be as open as possible and to stay engaged in the Python community as I transitioned and I will discuss why I made that decision and the levels of acceptance and support I encountered.

Transition has been wonderfully successful, but that very transition put me in a surprisingly different world. Now being part of not one, but at least 3 groups that are minorities in the Python world gave me a very different view of a community I thought I knew, and pushed me to being an activist (or trouble maker) in spite of myself. In addition to the many positives the Python community has offered me on my journey, I will discuss the experiences that have made me understand that privilege is very much alive and well in the Python world."

OpenNI allows you operate several 3D sensors, enabling hardware independent game development (supported 3D sensors are Microsoft Kinect, PrimeSense Carmine or Asus XTion). It also runs on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.

-----

This talk will start with a brief introduction to 3D Sensors and OpenNI. Then we’ll surf into PyOpenNI,  features such as the skeleton, hand and gesture tracking, RGB and depth video. Every topic will be presented with practical demos. The talk will end with a demo integrating WebGL (THREE.JS), 3D sensors, Flask and ZMQ to produce a simple fully open source based NUI game.

Some simple demos of PyOpenNI and PyGame can be found at [1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI2ktioiPY8) and [2](http://youtu.be/3e8jibGUQ2Q)

Attendees will not only learn about game related technologies but also about innovative ways of doing domotics, cinema & art, Interactive visualization, scientific research, educations, etc.

3D Sensors will be available for testing during the event - you can get yours for about 80 to 140 Euros (depending on the brand). Slides and demo code will be available at Github.

Abstract
To help create award winning visual effects, MPC developed a distributed service-oriented platform, Amanda.
Amanda allows developers of any level to write a service that is presented to users across 8 facilities globally without them requiring any
knowledge of building large concurrent systems. It allows artists and developers across different domains to work with
clearly defined API's and gives the service developer control over what and how data can and should be accessed.
The talk will cover how to set up such a platform from the ground up. Starting at the service level building it out with
additional modules and technologies until the fully distributed system, covering topics such as concurrency, componetisation and monitoring that allow the
fine tuning of setups depending on the type of work being undertaken and changing business needs."

[EuroPython 2014]
[23 July 2014]

PyPy, the Python implementation written in Python, experimentally supports Transactional Memory (TM). The strength of TM is to enable a novel use of multithreading, inheritently safe, and not limited to special use cases like other approaches. This talk will focus on how it works under the hood.
http://pypy.org/talk/ep2014-stm.html

-----

PyPy is a fast alternative Python implementation.  Software Transactional Memory (STM) is a current academic research topic.  Put the two together --brew for a couple of years-- and we get a version of PyPy that runs on multiple cores, without the infamous Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).

The current research is based on a recent new insight that promises to give really good performance.  The speed of STM is generally measured by two factors: the ability to scale with the number of CPUs, and the amount of overhead when compared with other approaches in a single CPU (in this case, with the regular PyPy with the GIL).  Scaling is not really a problem here, but single-CPU performance is --or used to be. This new approach gives a single-threaded overhead that should be very low, maybe 20%, which would definitely be news for STM systems.  Right now (February 2014) we are still implementing it, so we cannot give final numbers yet, but early results on a small interpreter for a custom language are around 15%.  This looks like a deal-changer for STM.

In the talk, I will describe our progress, hopefully along with real numbers and demos.  I will then dive under the hood of PyPy to give an idea about how it works.  I will conclude with a picture of how the future of multi-threaded programming might looks like, for high-level languages like Python.  I will also mention CPython: how hard (or not) it would be to change the CPython source code to use the same approach."

[EuroPython 2014]
[25 July 2014]

UNIX core-dumps, Windows minidumps or Java heap-dumps are well established technologies for post-mortem defect analysis.
I'll present a similar technology for Python. An improved pickling mechanism makes it possible to serialise the state of a Python 
program for subsequent analysis with a conventional Python-debugger.

-----

Post-Mortem Debugging with Heap-Dumps
===

UNIX core-dumps, Windows minidumps and analogous solutions of other operating systems are well established technologies for 
post-mortem defect analysis of native-code processes. In principle those dumps can be used to analyse „interpreted“ 
programs running within a native-code interpreter-process. However in practise this approach is tedious and not always successful \[1\].
Therefore operating system independent dump methods were developed for some „interpreted“ languages \[2\]. 
A prominent example are Java heap dumps \[3\]. 

Unfortunately up to now there was no practically usable dump-method for Python. Various attempts were made 
to utilise OS-level dump methods \[4, 5\]. In 2012 Eli Finer published the Python module *pydump* \[6\].
This module pickles the traceback of an exception and subsequently uses the pdb debugger to analyse the unpickled traceback.
Unfortunately *pydump* fails on PicklingErrors.

In my talk I'll present the Python package [*pyheapdump*](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyheapdump). It has the same operation principle as Eli's *pydump*, but 
is an independent implementation. *pyheapdump* uses an extended pickler 
([sPickle](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sPickle)) to serialise all relevant objects 
of a Python process to a file. Later on a fault tolerant unpickler recreates the objects and a common Python
debugger can be used to analyse the dump. The pickler extensions make it possible to:

 * pickle and unpickle many commonly not pickleable objects [7].
 * replace the remaining not pickleable objects by surrogate objects so that the resulting object graph is
   almost isomorphic to the original object graph.
   
Which objects are relevant? In its default operation mode *pyheapdump* 
uses the frame-stacks of all threads as start point for pickling. Following the 
usual rules for pickling the dump includes all local variables and all objects 
reachable from a local variable and so on. That is usually enough for a successful defect analysis.

Compared with other Python post-mortem debugging methods *pyheapdump* has several advantages:

 * It is a pure Python solution and independent from the operation system.
 * Creation of the pyheapdump and fault analysis can be performed different computers.
 * It is not obstructive. It does not modify / monkey-patch or disturb the dumped 
   process in any way, with the exception of loading additional modules.
 * If used with the Pydev-debugger, it supports multi-threaded applications.
 * If used with the Pydev-debugger and Stackless Python, it supports tasklets. 

The implementation of *pyheapdump* is fairly small, because it draws most of its functionality 
from the underlying sPickle package and from the new Stackless-Support \[8\] of the
Pydev-Debugger. Therefore it is - despite of its short history - already a useful piece of software.

[EuroPython 2014]
[23 July 2014]

Compression is a general technique for reducing the size of datasets that normally lie on disk or that should be sent remotely.  But time has come to use it as a means to accelerate applications that uses in-memory data too.
Blosc is a high-performance meta-compressor that is meant to do that.

-----

Compression is a technique to reduce the number of bits needed to
represent a given dataset. A very common use-case in the distributed
digital age is to reduce the size of files in order to reduce the time
and bandwidth requirements of sending a file from one location to
another.

There are a large variety of different algorithms and implementations of
so called ""codecs"" - a term is derived from the fact that programs that
implement a compression algorithm commonly constitute of both a
compressor and a corresponding decompressor. There are many different
special purpose compressors that exploit specifics in the structure of the
input data, for example: MP3, Ogg and FLAC for audio data such as music,
GIF, JPEG and PNG for images and  MPEG for encoding video. Also, there
are many general purpose codecs that make no assumptions about the
structure of the data, for example: Zlib(DEFLATE), Bzip2(BWT) and LZMA.

However, and due to the ever growing divide between memory access latency and CPU clock
speed a new use-case beyond faster file transfers and more efficient use
of disk-space has emerged: ""in-memory compression"".


Keeping data in RAM that is compressed also means that the CPU has to
do more work in order to make use of it.  However, if the compressor
is fast enough, this decompression overhead could pay off, and
applications could work with compressed data transparently, and so not
even noticing the slowdown due to the extra effort for
compression/decompression.

This technique can be very beneficial in a variety of scenarios where
RAM availability is critical.  For example, in-memory caching systems
like Memcached or Redis could store more data using the same resources
thereby optimizing resource usage.  Another use case is to use
compression for in-memory data containers, à la NumPy's ndarray or
Pandas' DataFrame, allowing for improved memory usage and potentially
allow for accelerated computations.

In our talk, we will explain first why we are in a moment of computer
history that [in-memory compression can be beneficial for modern
applications] [1].

Then, we will introduce [Blosc] [2], a high speed
meta-compressor, allowing other existing compressors (BloscLZ, LZ4,
Snappy or even Zlib) to leverage the SIMD and multithreading framework
that it provides and help achieving extremely fast operation
(frequently faster than a plain memcpy() system call).

Finally, we will show some existing data handling libraries ([Bloscpack] [3], [PyTables] [4], [BLZ] [5]) -- all written in Python -- that
already use Blosc today for fulfilling the promise of faster operations by
doing in-memory compressing.

Tables are a very handy data structure to store
datasets to perform data analysis (filters, groupings, sortings,
alignments...).
But it turns out that how the tables are actually implemented makes a large impact on how they perform.
Learn what you can expect from the current tabular offerings in the Python ecosystem.

-----

It is a fact: we just entered in the Big Data era.  More sensors, more
computers, and being more evenly distributed throughout space and time
than ever, are forcing data analyists to navigate through oceans of
data before getting insights on what this data means.

Tables are a very handy and spreadly used data structure to store
datasets so as to perform data analysis (filters, groupings, sortings,
alignments...).  However, the actual table implementation, and
especially, whether data in tables is stored row-wise or column-wise,
whether the data is chunked or sequential, whether data is compressed or not,
among other factors, can make a lot of difference depending on the
analytic operations to be done.

My talk will provide an overview of different libraries/systems in the
Python ecosystem that are designed to cope with tabular data, and how
the different implementations perform for different operations.  The
libraries or systems discussed are designed to operate either with
on-disk data ([PyTables] [1], [relational databases] [2], [BLZ] [3],
[Blaze] [4]...) as well as in-memory data containers ([NumPy] [5],
[DyND] [6], [Pandas] [7], [BLZ] [3], [Blaze] [4]...).

A special emphasis will be put in the on-disk (also called
out-of-core) databases, which are the most commonly used ones for
handling extremely large tables.

The hope is that, after this lecture, the audience will get a better
insight and a more informed opinion on the different solutions for
handling tabular data in the Python world, and most especially, which
ones adapts better to their needs.

[23 July 2014]

The (perceived) risk of the DevOps is that too many people get the right to ""break"" the platform.
Test Driven Infrastructure is about adapting proven ideas from our developer colleagues to the development and operations of Infrastructure services like virtualization, OS provisioning, postfix configuration, httpd configuration, ssh tuning, SAN LUN mounting and others.
This talk shows how ImmobilienScout24 utilizes more and more test driven development in IT operations to increase quality and to mitigate the risk of opening up the infrastructure developmen to all developers.

-----

Common wisdom has it that the test effort should be related to the risk of a change. However, the reality is different: Developers build elaborate automated test chains to test every single commit of their application. Admins regularly “test” changes on the live platform in production. But which change carries a higher risk of taking the live platform down?

What about the software that runs at the “lower levels” of your platform, e.g. systems automation, provisioning, proxy configuration, mail server configuration, database systems etc. An outage of any of those systems can have a financial impact that is as severe as a bug in the “main” software!
One of the biggest learnings that any Ops person can learn from a Dev person is Test Driven Development. Easy to say - difficult to apply is my personal experience with the TDD challenge.

This talk throws some light on recent developments at ImmobilienScout24 that help us to develop the core of our infrastructure services with a test driven approach:

* How to do unit tests, integration tests and systems tests for infrastructure services?
* How to automatically verify Proxy, DNS, Postfix configurations before deploying them on live servers?
* How to test “dangerous” services like our PXE boot environment or the automated SAN mounting scripts?
* How to add a little bit of test coverage to everything we do.
* Test Driven: First write a failing test and then the code that fixes it.

The tools that we use are Bash, Python, Unit Test frameworks and Teamcity for build and test automation.

Often, experiments with real world systems are high-risk, accompanied by high
costs or not even possible at all. That’s when simulations come into play.
This talk will give a brief introduction into the topic of simulation. By means
of simple examples, it will demonstrate how you can use SimPy to implement
event-discrete simulations and which features SimPy offers to help you doing
that.

-----

Simulation is important for the analysis of complex systems or the analysis of
the impact of certain actions on that systems. They are especially useful if
the actions are potentially harmful or expensive.

Simulation is used in various natural scientific and economic areas, e.g., for
the modeling and study of biological or physical systems, for resource
scheduling and optimization or at the research for the integration of renewable
energies into the power grid (my personal background). The simulated time can
thereby be seen as continuous or discrete (discrete time or discrete event).

In this talk, I want to show why Python is a good choice for implementing
simulation models and how SimPy can help here.

Structure of the talk (20min talking + 5min discussion + 5min buffer):

- Why simulation? (5min)
- History of SimPy (3min)
- How does SimPy work? (9min)
- Conclusion (3min)

In the introduction, I’ll briefly explain what simulation is and motivate, why
it is a useful tool.

The main part will consist of an introduction and demonstration of SimPy. Since
SimPy is now more then ten years old, I’ll first give a quick overview about
its history and development. Afterwards, I’ll explain SimPy’s concepts and
features by means of simple examples.

In the conclusion, I’ll give a short outlook on the future development of
SimPy.

The main goal of this talk is to create awareness that simulation is a powerful
tool in a lot of domains and to give the audience enough information to ease
their first steps."

[EuroPython 2014]
[24 July 2014]

This talk will teach you about Elasticsearch and Lucene's architecture.
The key data structure in search is the powerful inverted index, which is actually simple to understand. We start there, then ascend through abstraction layers to get an overview of how a distributed search cluster processes searches and changes.

-----

## Who I am and motivation
I work with hosted Elasticsearch and have interacted with lots of developers. We see what many struggle with.

Some relevant theory helps a lot. What follows has already lead to many ""Aha!""-moments and developers piecing things together herself.

## The inverted index
The most important index structure is actually very simple. It is essentially a sorted dictionary of terms, with a list of postings per term.

We show three simple sample documents and the resulting inverted index.

## The index term
The index term is the ""unit of search"", and the terms we make decide how we can search.

With the inverted index and its sorted dictionary, we can quickly search for terms given their prefix.

## Importance of text analysis
Thus, we need to transform our search problems into string prefix problems.

This is done with text analysis, which is the process of making of index terms. It is highly important when implementing search.

## Building indexes
The way indexes are built must balance how compact an index is, how easily we can search in it, how fast we can index documents - and the time it takes for changes to be visible.

Lucene, and thus Elasticsearch, builds them in segments.

## Index segments
A Lucene index consists of index segments, i.e. immutable mini-indexes.

A search on an index is done by doing the search on all segments and merging the results.

Segments are immutable:

This enables important compression techniques.
Deletes are not immediate, just a marker.
Segments are occasionally merged to larger segments. Then documents are finally deleted.
New segments are made by buffering changes in memory, and written when flushing happens. Flushes are largely caused by refreshing every second, due to real time needs.

## Caches
Caches like filter- and field caches are managed per segment. They are essential for performance.

Immutable segments make for simple reasoning about caches. New segments only cause partial cache invalidations.

## Elasticsearch indexes
Much like a Lucene index is made up of many segments, an Elasticsearch index is made up of many Lucene indexes.

Two Elasticsearch indexes with 1 shard is essentially the same as one Elasticsearch index with 2 shards.

Search all shards and merge. Much like segments, but this time possibly across machines.

Shard / Index routing enables various partitioning strategies. Simpler than it sounds, so one important example:

Essential for time based data, like logs: can efficiently skip searching entire indexes - and roll out old data by deleting the entire index.

## Common pitfalls
We must design our indexing for how we search - not the searches for how things are indexed. Be careful with wildcards and regexes.

Since segments are immutable, deleting documents is expensive while deleting an entire index is cheap.

Updating documents is essentially a delete and re-index. Heavy updating might cause problems.

Have enough memory and then some. Elasticsearch is very reliant on its caches.

## Summary
We've seen how index structures are used, and why proper text processing is essential for performant searches.

Also, you now know what index segments are, and how they affect both indexing and searching strategies.

[22 July 2014]

In Python, we're trying to solve packaging problems in our own domain, but maybe someone else already solved most our problems.
In the talk I'll show how I develop and deploy Python projects that can be easily mixed with non-Python dependencies.
http://nixos.org/nix/ will be demonstrated to replace technologies in our stack: pip, virtualenv, buildout, ansible, jenkins.

-----

Python is often mixed with other languages in development stack, nowadays it's hard to escape any JavaScript dependencies. If you add some C dependencies such as GStreamer to the stack, packaging becomes a burden.

While tweaking our packaging infrastructure will make things better, it's hard to fix fundamental problem of packaging with current ad-hoc solutions in Python domain.

Using Nix (http://nixos.org/nix/) for about a year gave me an insight that solving packaging problem at operating system level (bottom-up) is a better approach.

For example, wouldn't it be cool to have ""virtualenv"" implemented inside your package manager, so you could isolate also non-Python dependencies and not just Python packages for your project and not worry if system was updated?

We'll also show what benefits do we get by using the same tool for development and deployment and how little we have to do to deploy our application.

Command-Line programs can have a lot to them - usually more than you think, yet often suffer from a lack of thought.
This is a tour through how to structure your code, tools in the standard library and some 3rd party libraries. Take your command-line programs to the next level!

-----

Python is a great language for writing command-line tools - which is why so much of Linux is secretly written in Python these days. Unfortunately, what starts as a simple script can quickly get out of hand as more features are added and more people start using it!

The talk will consist of a tour through various useful libraries and practical code showing how each can be used, and include advice on how to best structure simple and complex command-line tools.

Things to consider when writing command-line apps:

* Single-file vs Multiple-file
* Standard library only vs. 3rd party requirements
* Installation - setup.py vs. native packaging

The different parts of a command-line program:

* Option Parsing:
    * Libraries: getopt, optparse, argparse, docopt
    * Sub-commands
* Configuration:
    * Formats: Ini file, JSON, YAML
    * Where should it be stored (cross-platform);
    * Having multiple configuration files, and allowing user config to override global config
* Output:
    * Colour - colorama
    * Formatting output for the user
    * Formatting output for other programs
    * How do you know when your output is being piped to another program?
    * Managing logging and verbosity
* Managing streamed input
* Exit values: What are the conventions?
* Interactive apps - REPL
* Structuring a bunch of programs/commands around a shared codebase.
* Command-line frameworks: clint, compago & cliff
* Testing command-line apps
* Writing command-line tools in Python 3 vs Python 2"

[23 July 2014]

At the example of our in-house distributed scheduling system, we discuss the challenges of embedding the Python interpreter in a C++ program. Besides the actual integration of the interpreter, efficient data exchange between both languages is discussed. In addition, this presentation demonstrates how higher-level abstractions further diminish the language barrier.

-----

Python with its huge standard library and sophisticated packages developed by its thriving community has become an incredibly useful tool for data scientists. At Blue Yonder, we value Python for the ease with which we can access and combine machine learning algorithms to build accurate prediction models.

To get the most business value out of the use of Python, we strive to rid our model developers from all burdens outside their core expertise, i.e., developing statistical models. To leverage our existing infrastructure, essentially a distributed scheduling system written in C++, we decided to embed a Python interpreter in our application. The goal was to let developers use the language best suited for their problem, and to let them incorporate code created by others even if it is not written in the same language.

In this presentation, I will talk about a few obstacles which we had to overcome in integrating the (C)Python interpreter in our C++ program, e.g., clean resource management, error handling, and broken features in the interpreter's API. I will show how we employed features from the [Boost Python C++ library](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_55_0/libs/python/) not only for simple data exchange, but also for more powerful concepts such as data sources. Finally, I will demonstrate how C++ objects can be used to seamlessly interact with Python, for example to use Python's logging package as usual while the actual logging is handled by our C++ application.

With this combination of both worlds, we achieved a desirable mix of virtues: safe, reliable operations; good run-time performance; fast development; and highly expressive, unit testable core domain logic."

[25 July 2014]

Stratosphere is a distributed platform for advanced big data analytics. It features a rich set of operators, advanced, iterative data flows, an efficient runtime, and automatic program optimization. We present Stratophere's new Python programming interface. It allows Python developers to easily get their hands on Big Data.

-----

[Stratosphere](http://stratosphere.eu/) is implemented in Java. In 2013 we introduced support for writing Stratosphere programs in Scala. Since Scala also runs in the Java JVM the language integration was easy for Scala.

In late 2013, we started to develop a generic language binding framework for Stratosphere to support non-JVM languages such as Python, JavaScript, Ruby but also compiled languages such as C++. The language binding framework uses [Google’s Protocol Buffers](https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/) for efficient data serialization and transportation between the languages.

Since many “Data Scientists” and machine learning experts are using Python on a daily basis, we decided to use Python as the reference implementation for Stratosphere’s language binding feature.
Our talk at the EuroPython 2014 will present how Python developers can leverage the Stratosphere Platform to solve their big data problems.

We introduce the most important concepts of Stratosphere such as the operators, connectors to data sources, data flows, the compiler, iterative algorithms and more.
Stratosphere is a mature, next generation big-data analytics platform developed by a vibrant [open-source community](https://github.com/stratosphere/stratosphere). The system is available under the Apache 2.0 license. 

The project started in 2009 as a joint research project of multiple universities in the Berlin area (Technische Universität, Humboldt Universität and Hasso-Plattner Institut). Nowadays it is an award winning system that has gained worldwide attention in both research and industry.

A note to the program committee: As mentioned, the development of the Python language binding of Stratosphere has started a few months ago, therefore, the code is not yet in the main development branch. However, we are already able to execute the “Hello World” of big data, the “Word Count” example using the Python interface. See this example in the development branch: https://github.com/filiphaase/stratosphere/blob/langbinding/stratosphere-addons/stratosphere-language-binding/src/main/python/eu/stratosphere/language/binding/wordcountexample/WordCountPlan.py

At last year's Europython Holger Krekel gave a keynote called ""The Return of Peer to Peer Computing"". He described how developers, in light of the Snowden surveillance revelations, ought to learn about and build decentralized peer-to-peer systems with strong cryptography. This talk introduces, describes and demonstrates ideas, concepts and code that a group of Pythonistas have been working on since Holger's keynote. 
We asked ourselves two questions: what are the fundamental elements / abstractions of a peer-to-peer application and, given a reasonable answer to the first question, what can we build?  We will present work done so far, discuss the sorts of application that might be written and explore how peer-to-peer technology could be both attractive and viable from an economic point of view.

-----

This talk introduces, describes and demonstrates concepts and code created during sprints and via online collaboration by a distributed group of Pythonistas under the working title p4p2p (http://p4p2p.net).

We asked ourselves, as frameworks such as Zope/Plone, Django, Pyramid or Flask are to web development what would the equivalent sort of framework look like for peer-to-peer application development?

We've tackled several different technical issues: remote execution of code among peers, distributed hash tables as a mechanism for peer discovery and data storage, various cryptographic requirements and the nuts and bolts of punching holes in firewalls.

Work is ongoing (we have another sprint at the end of March) and the final content of the talk will depend on progress made. However, we expect to touch upon the following (subject to the caveat above):

* What is the problem we're trying to solve?
* Why P2P?
* The story of how we ended up asking the questions outlined in the abstract.
* What we've done to address these questions.
* An exploration of the sorts of application that could be built using P2P.
* A call for helpers and collaboration.

[EuroPython 2014]

Rope is a powerful Python refactoring library. Traad (Norwegian for “thread”) is a tool which makes it simpler to integrate rope into IDEs via a simple HTTP API. In this session we’ll look at how traad and rope work together and how traad integrates with at least one popular editor.

-----

Python is a modern, dynamic language which is growing in popularity, but tool support for it is sometime lacking or only available in specific environments. For refactoring and other common IDE functions, however, the powerful open-source rope library provides a set of tools which are designed to be integrated into almost any programming environment. Rope supports most common refactorings, such as renaming and method extraction, but also more Python-specific refactorings, such as import organization. Rope’s underlying code analysis engine also allows it to do things like locating method definitions and generating auto-completion suggestions.

While rope is designed to be used from many environments, it’s not always easy or ideal to integrate rope directly into other programs. Traad  (Norwegian for “thread”) is another open-source project that addresses this problem by wrapping rope into a simple client-server model so that client programs (IDEs, editors, etc.) can perform refactorings without needing to embed rope directly. This simplifies dependencies, makes clients more robust in the face of errors, eases traad client development, and even allows clients to do things like switch between Python 2 and 3 refactoring in the same session.

In this session we’ll look at how rope operates, and we’ll see how traad wraps it to provide an easier integration interface. The audience will get enough information to start using rope themselves, either directly or via traad, and they’ll see how to use traad for integrating rope into their own environments. More generally, we’ll look at why client-server refactoring tools might be preferable to the more standard approach of direct embedding."

#Statistics 101 for System Administrators

## Agenda
 * A latency issue
 * Data distribution
 * 30 seconds correlation with pearsonr
 * Combinating data
 * Plotting and the power of color

## An use case 
 - Network latency issues
 - Correlate latency with other events 
    
## First statistics 
 - we created our parsing library 
 - [using various recipes](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000393/ch06.html)
 - Having the data in a dict like

        &gt; table = {
        &gt;   'time': [ 1,2,3, ..],
        &gt;   'elapsed': [ 0.12, 12.43, ..],
        &gt;   'error': [ 2, 0, ..],
        &gt;   'size': [123,3223, ..],
        &gt;   'peers': [2313, 2303, ..],

 - It's easy to get max, min and standard deviation

        &gt; print [k, max(v), min(v), stats.mean(v) ] for k,v in table.items() ]

## Distribution 
 - A distribution shows event frequency 

        &gt; from matplotlib import pyplot
        &gt; pyplot.hist(table['elapsed'])

 - Time and Size distributions

## (Linear) Correlation 
 - What's correlation
 - What's not correlation
 - pearsonr and probability
 - catch for linear correlation

        &gt; from scipy.stats.stats import pearsonr
        &gt; a, b = range(0,10), range(0,20, 2)
        &gt; c = [randint(0,10) for x in a]
        &gt; pearsonr(a, b), pearsonr(a,c)
        &gt; (1.0, 0.0), (0.43, 0.2)

## Combinations 
 - using itertools.combinations

[24 July 2014]

A lot of people have heard of Jython, some have tried it, but it seems few have actually deployed it in a corporate environment. In this talk I'll share my experiences in using Jython as a testbed for Java applications, for rapid prototyping in Java desktop and web environments, and for embedding scripting capabilities in Java products.

-----

Not everyone gets paid to work with Python all the time, but if you find yourself in a Java project, there are good chances you could benefit from Python without throwing out the Java stack. Using Jython, you can do rapid prototyping without the long edit-compile-test cycles normally associated with large Java projects, whether on the web or the desktop, and when testing an application might become a nightmare of scaffolding in Java, a little Jython may be just what you need to be able to run your tests smoothly.

At the end of this talk, I will put on my politician´s hat and bring up the best - and worst - arguments to use to get permission to use Jython in a corporate environment."

What this talk is about ?
==================
- What is Web Scraping  and its usefulness
- Which libraries are available for the job
- Open Source vs proprietary alternatives
- Whaich library is best for which job
- When and when not to use Scrapy

What is Web Scraping ?
==================
Web scraping (web harvesting or web data extraction) is a 
computer software technique of extracting information from 
websites.  - Wikipedia

###In simple words :
It is a method to extract data from a website that does not 
have an API or we want to extract a LOT of data which we 
can not do through an API due to rate limiting.

We can extract any data through web scraping which we can 
see while browsing the web.

Usage of web scraping in real life.
============================
- to extract product information
- to extract job postings and internships
- extract offers and discounts from deal-of-the-day websites
- Crawl forums and social websites
- Extract data to make a search engine
- Gathering weather data etc

Advantages of Web scraping over using an API 
========================
- Web Scraping is not rate limited
- Anonymously access the website and gather data
- Some websites do not have an API
- Some data is not accessible through an API etc

Which libraries are available for the job ?
================================
There are numerous libraries available for web scraping in 
python. Each library has its own weaknesses and plus points.

Some of the most widely known libraries used for web scraping are:

- BeautifulSoup
- html5lib
- lxml
- re ( not really for web scraping, I will explain later )
- scrapy ( a complete framework )

A comparison between these libraries
==============================
- speed
- ease of use
- what do i prefer
- which library is best for which purpose

Proprietary alternatives
==================
- a list of proprietary scrapers
- their price
- are they really useful for you ?

Working of proprietary alternatives
===========================
- how they work (render javascript)
- why they are not suitable for you
- how custom scrapers beat proprietary alternatives

Scrapy
=======
- what is it
- why is it useful
- asynchronous support
- an example scraper

Question
=======
- Questions from the viewers"

Morepath is a server web framework written with modern, rich client web development in mind. Why another new Python web framework in 2014? 
Because it can be done better: Morepath understands how to construct hyperlinks from models. Writing a generic view in Morepath is like writing any other view. With Morepath, you can reuse, extend and override apps as easily as you can construct them.
Even if you don't end up using Morepath, you will learn something about how the nature of web frameworks.

[Morepath](http://morepath.readthedocs.org) is a new server web
framework written with modern, rich client web development in mind.

In the talk I will be discussing some core features of Morepath that
make it different:

* Its different take on routing and linking. Morepath has support
  to help you construct hyperlinks to models.
* Its view system: plain views, generic views, view composition.
* Morepath's approach to application construction allows application extension and overriding, and composition.

This talk will attempt to convince people to try Morepath. For those
unable or unwilling to try, I will communicate some design principles
behind Morepath which can be of help to any web developer."

Abstract
=======

OpenStack is a huge, open-source cloud provider. One of the main tenets of OpenStack is the (Shared Nothing Architecture) to which all modules stick very closely. In order to do that, services within OpenStack have adopted different strategies to integrate themselves and share data without sacrificing performance nor moving away from SNA.

This strategies are not applicable just to OpenStack but to any distributed system. Sharing data, regardless what that data is, is a must-have requirement of any successful cloud service.

This talk will present some of the existing integration strategies that are applicable to cloud infrastructures and enterprise services. The talk will be based on the strategies that have helped OpenStack to be successful and most importantly, scalable.

Details
======

Along the lines of what I've described in the abstract, the presentation will walk the audience through the state of the art of existing system integration solutions, the ones that have been adopted by OpenStack and the benefits of those solutions. At the end of the talk, a set of solutions under development, ideas and improvements to the existing ones will be presented.

The presentation is oriented to distributed services, fault-tolerance and replica determinism. It's based on a software completely written in python and running successfully on several production environments.

The presentation will be split in 3 main topics:

Distributed System integration
-----------------------------------

* What's it ?
* Why is it essential for cloud infrastructures?
* Existing methods and strategies

OpenStack success story
----------------------------

* Which methods did OpenStack adopt?
* How / Why do they work?
* What else could be done?

Coming Next
---------------

* Some issues of existing solutions
* What are we doing to improve that?
* Other solutions coming up"

I will tell a story of one programmer discovering such problems. The talk will take listeners on a journey of issues they can encounter, tools they can use to debug the problems and possible solutions to seek out. There will also be a brief mention of general memory management principles.

cPython uses a combination of its own allocator, `malloc`, and `mmap` pools to manage memory of Python programs. It usually is smart enough, but there are some darker corners that are not well known by an average Joe Programmer (read: me). 

There are tools that can help debug memory problems, but those are also relatively unknown, and tend to have documentation that one might find lacking. I will describe one such tool, called `guppy`, which I have found particulary helpful."

In this talk I will present ways to interface with this device and to analyze their data, mostly from the perspective of a Python hacker, and not so much from the perspective of academic research or the development of production-ready software. 
I will convey the basic scientific and technical background, keeping in mind the non-medical audience, and touch on several practical applications, especially Neurofeedback and its use for personal mental training and potential therapeutic uses.
The Audience can expect to walk away with a basic knowledge of EEG analysis, Neurofeedback and how to start experimenting with these devices on their own.

-----

A new class of cheap consumer EEG devices allows ordinary hackers and even high school students a glimpse into the human brain.

This talk will present how to use the ""Neurosky Mindwave"" headset with python software, and lay out the basic scientific and technical background.

The Mindwave Mobile is a device that can be easily talked to using bluetooth, and it talks a binary protocol which is specifically designed to be useful without  much computing power in the receiving device or advanced knowledge of signal processing. In fact, an Arduino with a few lines of code is perfectly capable of parsing some of the byte stream and reacting to the mental state of the user, while fully-featured python software can do advanced analysis using PyEEG and Pandas.

The same hardware module and protocol is used in the Nekomimi headset (mind-controlled cat ears for cosplay) and some Boardgames (MindFlex).

A python library for interfacing with the headset is presented and will be demonstrated on stage. Mostly kivy applications will be used.

Also I will present some data analysis you can perform with pandas and scipy.

Neurofeedback is a type of mental exercise where a computer uses the EEG data to direct the user towards certain mental states. In the easiest configuration a program would display a bar with the ""concentration"" level, and the user would learn how to tilt this bar upwards. In more complicated setups a game could react favorably towards states like relaxation or concentration. Using Gamification, Neurofeedback can provide a more engaging experience for children or adults, than other techniques with similar goals, like mindfulness meditation, and the more immediate feedback should enhance the effectiveness of mental training, though that has not been investigated scientifically yet.

Neurofeedback has been shown to be effective (albeit not recommended as sole treatment) in Patients with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Epilepsy and Dementia. Some background about these conditions and applications of Neurofeedback to them will be given. The first use of Neurofeedback was done in Cats, during early experiments with EEG electrodes in the 60ies. Cats where conditioned to exhibit certain wave patterns, and later, due to a coincidence, the researchers noticed that the conditioned cats where more resistant to epilepsy-inducing medications. The effect has since been reproduced in humans, in cases where medications did not work sufficiently.

Ample hints on not to treat any of this information as medical advice will be provided.

The goal of this talk is to promote Neurofeedback as a useful mental training and to encourage development of applications around Neurofeedback and the analysis of EEG data, from the perspective of a python hacker.

I gave a similar talk at PyConDe 2013 in Cologne. The new talk will be in English, show some improvements on the software, and more advanced demonstrations."

[EuroPython 2014]
[24 July 2014]

Pony ORM is an Object-Relational Mapper implemented in Python. It uses an unusual approach for writing database queries using Python generators. Pony analyzes the abstract syntax tree of a generator and translates it to its SQL equivalent. The translation process consists of several non-trivial stages. In this talk one of Pony ORM authors will reveal the internal details of this process.

-----

[Pony ORM](http://ponyorm.com) is an object-relational mapper implemented in Python. It allows writing advanced queries to a database using plain Python in the form of a generator expression. This way queries look very concise.

The main feature of Pony is to provide a method to write declarative queries to databases in pure Python using generators. For this purpose Pony analyzes the abstract syntax tree of a generator and translates it to its SQL equivalent.

Following is a sample of a query in Pony:

    select(p for p in Product if ""iPad"" in p.name and p.price &gt;= 500)

This query translates to SQL using a specific database dialect. Currently Pony works with SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL and Oracle databases.

In this talk one of Pony ORM authors will go through the process of the query translation and dig into the implementation details.

Attendees are going to walk away with the understanding of: 

1. Principles of building a programming language translator
2. Python to SQL translator implementation details 
3. Approaches for creating a pluggable translator architecture 

The presentation outline:

- Why Python generators are good for representing SQL queries
- Main stages of Python to SQL translation overview
- Decompiling Python bytecode into Python AST
- Translating Python AST to database-independent SQL representation
- Generating SQL for specific database
- Pluggable translator architecture
- Performance concerns: is such way of building SQL slower or faster then Django's and SQLAlchemy's?"

You've deployed! But your friends can't see it - what's wrong? I'm betting DNS. Maybe you've fixed a couple of entries, point some records to hostnames, waited patiently for new domains to resolve only to notice your nameservers are incorrect. But what actually goes on with DNS? Come to this talk to find out how DNS works, and how to interact and create a DNS with Python.

-----

Following instructions of what entries to create where is easy enough when using a PaaS.

But DNS is hard – deployment issues always seem to come down to DNS.

A solid understanding of DNS will not only help with deploying your applications, but will also give a greater understanding of how the internet works, and more generally, distributed systems.

In this talk, you will learn what DNS is, how it works and how to communicate with it, and how Python can make both interacting and spinning up your own DNS server simple (I swear!).  

Outline:

* Intro (1-2m)
* What DNS is (5 min)
    * URL -&gt; IP addr, e.g. ""phonebook"" lookup (obligatory pun: Call me, Maybe?)
    * hierarchical system & resolution sequence (local DNS cache/resolver, ISP resolver, recursive DNS search)
    * popular types (primary, secondary/slave, forwarding, authoritative only, etc)
    * System components: what makes a DNS?
* How to communicate with DNS (3 min)
    * Protocol: UDP
    * Operations: CRUD
    * Resource records (A, AAAA, CNAME, SOA, SRV, etc)
    * tools: dig/nsupdate/nslookup
* Security overview (3min) (disclaimer: NOT a DNS security expert, not planning to get into the details here)
    * Server-Server, DynDNS: TSIG/GSS-TSIG
    * Server-Client: DNSSEC
* Python + DNS (10 min)
    * plain UDP query in Python (no 3rd-party libraries/no magic)
    * Interacting with a DNS w/ Python (dnspython.py)

[EuroPython 2014]
[22 July 2014]

Those web pages with shiny lock icons boasting that your data is safe because of “256 bit encryption”? They are lying. In times of mass surveillance and commercialized Internet crime you should know why that’s the case. This talk will give you an overview that will help you to assess your personal security more realistically and to make your applications as secure as possible against all odds.

-----

The rule of thumb for people without degrees in cryptography on securing data on the Internet is “GPG for data at rest. TLS for data in motion”. And it’s actually a very good rule everyone should follow.

The only kicker though is that configuring (and using!) TLS properly is not as simple as it sounds and if you’re not diligent as a user, developer, and ops engineer, you can easily compromise your data’s security despite best effort of everyone else.

This talk will be multifaceted; you will learn:

- how SSL and TLS roughly work and why their state is sorry,
- server- and client-side duties for best possible security,
- what alternatives you have for using TLS in Python,
- things to keep in mind when configuring servers,
- and what perils outside your control still can trip you up.

In other words, the leitmotif is to show you the most common traps you should know about when using and deploying applications relying on TLS for transport layer security and how to avoid them."

[EuroPython 2014]
[24 July 2014]

Lessons learned when building a client for a fully distributed system and trying to minimize context-switching pains when using multiple languages.

-----

Last year we decided to create official clients for the most popular languages, Python included.

Some of the goals were:

* support the complete API of elasticsearch including all parameters
* provide a 1-to-1 mapping to the rest API to avoid having opinions and provide a familiar interface to our users consistent across languages and evironments
* degrade gracefully when the es cluster is changing (nodes dropping out or being added)
* flexibility - allow users to customize and extend the clients easily to suit their, potentially unique, environment

In this talk I would like to take you through the process of designing said client, the challenges we faced and the solutions we picked. Amongst other things I will touch on the difference between languages (and their respective communities), the architecture of the client itself, mapping out the API and making sure it stays up to date and integrating with existing tools."

This talk will show you GoldenEye. A setup of a robot, image recognition and Python. What could be better?
GoldenEye uses computer vision to detect icons on an attached mobile device and then tells a robot to tap them. All off these tests are written in python's unittest module and the API is as easy as possible to make writing complex tests an ease.

-----

GoldenEye is our solution for mobile front end tests. Testing on mobile devices can be quite devastating: On iOS you can write front test in JavaScript in Instruments but it is quite impossible to connect Instruments to you CI solution of choice. On Android the situation isn't much better.
Other front end test frameworks can work with mobile devices (or simulators) but they lack the ability to see. Of course you can check if a color is set correctly, if a frame has the right x and y coordinates but in a world of different screen sizes writing these tests can be quite challenging as well.
In the end you will always need to look on your screen again and again trying to spot any issues. 

GoldenEye takes a different approach. It does not need to run on your development computer, you don't need a Mac for running tests on iOS devices and you can have real touches on your controls. This is archived by using openCV and it's python bindings, Pythons's unittest module and the Tapsterbot, an OpenSource delta robot made with 3D printing and an Arduino controller. To write a test you just take some screenshots on your device, cut out the icons you need to tap or inspect and write a very simple unit test using a high-level API that takes away the hard parts.
