UgzZwbzu5M4dfjZeRMJ4AaABAg,"This is an excellent talk and resonates with most of my feelings on the subject especially regarding ORMs. Early in the talk you suggest that event sourcing is perhaps over used, but then later when you talk about domain events you suggest applying those events to the model. From my understanding of the definition this is exactly event sourcing. From what I also understand domain events and events used for event sourcing don’t necessarily have to be the same thing and, in fact, publishing the same events used for event sourcing to other bounded contexts can be detrimental or at least there are trade offs. It might not be a bad idea if you’re doing something like event carried state transfer, but then your contract with those services becomes all of those events so maybe not 🤷🏼‍♂️ Can you speak to this a bit more?",Jordan Pollard,UCP51C7M03fo5zZti_c_WIPQ,0,0,Ru2T4fu3bGQ,2020-09-07 14:47:14

as a Python developer, i looked at vs code many times before. docker integration was my hold-up but i believe most of it is done now. something i have not seen (not just in vs code but in other main python editors) is remote debugging with docker. it always seems like a not easily solved mystery whoever you ask. if the team at vs code solves it first, it will be a big win for them.",victor noagbodji,UCdwEEQIXYtfG2jyXu_ySnjQ,9,1,6YLMWU-5H9o,2018-11-23 21:45:15

Pyhton will first of all look for a data descriptor in the class dictionary (see https://codesachin.wordpress.com/2016/06/09/the-magic-behind-attribute-access-in-python/) and in this example it will not find it because the descriptor that is there is a non-data descriptor (it does not define __set__).,DrMic,UClXxphMMycg4JIaSxx7EwZg,0,0,TAuC086NNmo,2018-08-09 11:12:06

These not required parts are not constantly exposed they're not constantly running they're not imposing a security risks or attack area, they just exist in the package and thats it.

(  lower the min/max range if you have CPU heatsink installed, 30-65 worked for me )
( to check wiring : make all the leds active, change the range to 0 - current_temp+1 )
need current temp  then use ""vcgencmd measure_temp"" at cli $ or in a bash script.

Write optimum code from the beginning. Profile later to see if any small tweaks are required.

Ugxk4bfZqOkqhkcP-Ll4AaABAg,"I've seen some incredibly huge projects on Node.js and I've been writing software for about 20 years... I know I'm not the only voice in the room but in my opinion Node.js has been a complete disaster. While it solves some problems it creates way more than it's worth. In a node project it's typical to see untyped dictionaries just being passed around continuously as your data structure. The IDE has no clue what values are acceptable, yet you're expected to just know what's supposed to be passed... Node's asynchronous callback nature makes it very difficult to work with. When you have callback that made a call back from callback it's quickly to see how state and programming logic can be lost. Typically with any program you'd want synchronous calls to A B C D E and have a callback for F, but not in node. It does A.then(B).then(C).then(D).... you get my point. Python is fantastic for the backend and React or Angular are great for the front. People keep trying to cram this cross platform development stuff without realizing the actual added complexity of doing so. When I hear companies complain that they had to do their geo fencing function in two language for example, one for iOS and one for Android this really worries me who's at the top... Either build it in C++ and link it, or just do separate implementations in the native framework's they're working with...",Kevin Parker,UCudZ9lB9VmFipQR5H33favw,1,0,5RJRHBBX6LU,2020-07-30 15:12:03

UgyM_f2fvcgCZsSX0yx4AaABAg,Great presentation! James definitely shed some light on how to implement a real world solution using asyncio. Many of the guides and tutorials out there fall short by only showing the most basic functionality of asyncio (usually via await asyncio.sleep). Your solution is also a great example of separation of concerns by keeping asyncio logic out of your Python flavored redis internals. Looking forward to more of your presentations.,Austin Burrow,UCHv0X0XBjTFseRbBTk_O1hw,2,0,CF8zt8l6SeI,2018-10-04 19:15:29

http://www.ra-ma.es/libros/HACKING-ETICO-CON-HERRAMIENTAS-PYTHON/98877/978-84-9964-731-9

El objetivo del libro es capacitar a aquellos interesados en la seguridad, a aprender a utilizar Python como lenguaje de programación, no solo para poder construir aplicaciones, sino también para automatizar y especificar muchas de las tareas que se realizan durante un proceso de auditoría de seguridad.

Repasaremos desde los conceptos básicos de programación hasta construir nuestra propia herramienta de análisis y extracción de información. 

Con el objetivo de extraer información de servidores y servicios que están ejecutando, información como nombres de dominio y banners, conoceremos los módulos que ofrece python para extraer información que los servidores exponen de forma pública y veremos los módulos que permiten extraer metadatos de documentos e imágenes, así como extraer información de geolocalización a partir de direcciones IP y nombres de dominio. 

También analizaremos conceptos más avanzados, como implementar nuestro propio escáner de puertos con comandos nmap y scapy, además de cómo conectarnos desde python con servidores FTP, SSH, SNMP, Metaspoit y escáneres de vulnerabilidades como nexpose.",J.M.

Ugy-Sv-MOxFlmZ5Dhtd4AaABAg,"@15:30 I think there is confusion.  You *should* expect the subtraction to yield 'c' : -1  because ""subtraction"" is in our culture an arithmetical operation, and inverse to addition.  What Knuth (characteristically verbosely) called ""saturation subtraction"" is just a very simple elementary operation a child might call ""deletion"" or ""removal""  exactly same meaning in common English.   So for Counters C - B should be equivalent to C.subtract(B), and the Python library should have a different operation,
C.remove(B)

So with,
>>> c
Counter({'a': 4, 'c': 2, 'b': 1, 'z': 1, 't': 1})
>>> b
Counter({'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 1, 't': 1, 'z': 2})
we get, 
>>> c - b
Counter({'a': 3, 'c': 1})                                                       #  <--- the horror!
>>> c.subtract(b)
>>> c
Counter({'a': 3, 'c': 1, 'b': -2, 't': 0, 'z': -1})                        # fine.
So the infix subtract behaviour is a flaw IMHO.  Those two results should be equivalent and we should have instead,
>>> C.remove(B)
Counter({'a': 3, 'c': 1})

 Or at least:  C.setminus(B) instead of the counter-intuitive C - B for the saturation subtraction, but since Counters are not sets I would vote against that method name.

In the real world counters have gone negative since antiquity, since the earliest recorded writing, which were (if I recall) Sumerian records of credit/debt balance sheets of a sort.",Bijou Smith,UCQHd4WVQV3pXdEzJlqbKLYg,0,0,twrNGyl1sbc,2020-08-02 16:02:44

Ugii8Hcv8JYHMXgCoAEC,"Pathetic comparison!!! 

Everyone knows reading files in Fortran is slow. It has bad i/o. That is the one thing it is slow at.



Fortunately when running simulations you don't have to read a lot of files, you just have an input file with various parameters. 

Fortran is good for writing complex calculations into code - ie FOrumula TRANslation. A matrix equation will look much prettier written in Fortran code than in NumPy, where it will be littered with dot() and np.X,  and other gibberish. 

Try doing a math calculation like matrix multiplication,  calculating Fibonacci numbers, histogram binning of data, solving a simple ODE, FFT or convolution, and you will find modern Fortran is often 1000x faster if not more.

NASA found it was ~3000x faster at an actual physics problem (solving a PDE)
https://modelingguru.nasa.gov/docs/DOC-1762 

If you want to do serious scientific computing,( things like molecular dynamics, electronic structure calculations, astrodynamics, computational fluid dynamics, etc) Fortran is the way to go. 

Also,  it is hard to parallelize code in Python (MPI / MP, which are the best standards, are written for use with modern Fortran and C/C++. Fortran also has its own scheme called co-arrays).  

I have written more about this here:

This is true for hello world apps because in web2py one cannot switch off some header validation and session handling. On the other side, when using templates, they are faster in web2py then Django. When using databases' the db IO becomes the bottleneck and the two frameworks tend to perform more or less the same. For hello world apps, bottle.py and pure WSGI beat every other framework.

UgxOTXHzrvkr9Xh_gix4AaABAg,"Python is a cancer. And it really sucks. Most people are Lemmings, good followers, even in death close our eyes lets go. The fact it has spread like the dicease it is, is because of the school teachers too lazy to teach students how to import external libraries into their projects, instead lets all use python. And now everyone is fucked with this nonsensical workflow. I hope researchers open their eyes and stop using this garbage for their researchs.
The pip install features will never come close to linux library install commands such as yum/emerge/apt-get, most of the time when you try pip it throws deprecated messages, and you can never find the library you are looking for, only in rare cases it works. Python has become a hell to work with, so true that they created these Python Env management systems like anaconda. Where it downlaods entire pythons folders with all the 99% useless crap inside that no one will ever use.
Do you even realize ?? Instead of dumping this language they create more absurd layers of patching on top of it to try minimize the fact that it sucks at the core and is a total failure as a language.
Even Java is more convenient to work with.
I recognize it has minor advantages when you write little scripts, it beats MS DOS batch, but that's it for python.
If you have any program to write, use CSharp on Windows, don't fall in the ""no compile time"" trap, cause you will regret sooner or later.
The only reason why i invested time in python in the first place was because of the popularity, it seemed like you gained some time in the dev process, while iterating on features, then when things get more serious and you need to deploy or use advanced libraries, life becomes and inferno, project ends up rewritten in another language.",gen kidama,UCoC9Mj_gS_Ht4XdxcO0WvZw,1,3,PlXEsrhF1iE,2020-01-14 06:00:15

UghXclm3ESMyengCoAEC,"I cannot begin to describe how much I hate computer programming.  I've done it since 1981. The only time I ever did well in programming was in organized formal courses: Fortran (1981), C++ (2005), Java (2012). I worked hard, earned As, learned a lot. But the moment I stepped outside those courses, those languages become utterly worthless to me.

I've spent over a year and a half on Python now. I still cannot locate the keywords/statements/code/commands to do things I want,
such as let a variable n range from 7 to 12.  

That's the problem with programming: it takes years & years & years searching the universe for a single line of code.

I infinitely infinitely prefer math: proving mathematical theorems & doing mathematical modeling.

Also, note the proper way I use the word ""math"" & not this incorrect ""maths"".
